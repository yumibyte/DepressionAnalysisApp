 When I'm feeling better and have a little more energy I can act like myself but usually I'm just this shell. It's horrible, like watching the progression of ALS in a loved one; they just slowly fade away until there's nothing left of who they used to be. At least with physical illness or bipolar or whatever you have yourself, that fundamental spark of who you truly are, and you're able to show that and share that with others. I don't even have that privilege. 

Sorry if this comes off as arrogant or insensitive, this is just how I feel.

edit: Guys, thanks so much for all the responses. I appreciate all of you. I didn't know so many people felt the same way, and I'm glad if I was able to help give voice to your struggles. I've had depression my whole life so I've had a lot of time to think about these things. I think it helps to be able to really narrow down what you're feeling.

It’s the excuses you have to make when you can’t make that meeting. 

It’s the friends and family you’ve lost because you can’t explain why. 

It’s the opportunities that land in everyone else’s lap, that they get to grasp with both hands, while yours slip out of your grasp. 

It’s the exhaustion that binds your body to your bed. 

It’s the hatred and resentment you feel towards yourself, towards the world for being the way it is. 

It’s your proven truth that everything and everyone gets better, except for you. 

It’s the demon that dragged you down and trapped you in the hellish prison that is your own mind. 

It’s the ball and chain locked around your neck, choking the life out of you as you trudge through your marathon, while everyone else gets to charge on ahead, unimpeded. 

It’s the wall that blocked you off from life. 

It's the leech that sucked out everything positive about your life and clouds your memories. 

It’s not just being “sad”. And we can only wish it was.

As you could read by the title, I'm a black man. I've always been in the fight. Grew up with racism in all its forms in my country, which, ironically, usually denies there ever being racism in any way.

The kind of shit I've heard through my entire life has molded me into someone with no self-esteem, sense of self-worth, voice and made into introvert. Because of the mentality of ""you need to work twice as hard as everyone out there"", I always saw the future as bleak, tiresome and as more struggle. This never really changed. It just got worse with time, with college and the awful reality that came afterwards.

I've been depressed for most of my life, with my initial diagnosis at age 9. I still have it, with severe anxiety. My first suicidal thoughts came at age 8, and then and there I already hated myself for everything. For not being enough, for not being what the world wanted, for failing myself at being the best, for never getting anything good out of my own life, for never letting myself rest or be human.

And with all the recent events, like the absurd police brutality worldwide, the rise of authoritarianism in my country, with being worked to the bone and around the clock due to the pandemic, with my country quickly moving up to be the worst afflicted by covid-19 and my mom and me being in danger during these times by living in a neighbourhood near a place where a white supremacist parade happened, which also happens to be a place where a lot of people are simply disrespecting quarantine... All of this shit, is just wearing me down really badly.

I wake up exhausted. I can't deal with anything without having a serious bout of anxiety or anger outbursts, followed by fullscale breakdowns. I'm feeling guilty by worrying my friends and my mom. I feel guilty by feeling tired, by feeling afraid. I feel guilty by not feeling brave enough to go out on the streets for my people and taking action. I feel guilty for existing. I'm so fucking exhausted and I don't know what to do. I just want it all to end, I just wanna go somewhere else. I can't handle anything anymore.

Edit: all of this support... I'm very, very thankful for it. I think I've never felt this supported in my whole life. All of your words have touched me deeply. I'm so glad you helped me. I feel more hopeful, more energized from talking to you all. Thank you. Thank you all, from the bottom of my heart. You've all stopped me from doing something terrible today. Thank you.

It may seem a bit dramatic, but I'm legitimately walking out of this with a different outlook on life. I never expected to see so many people I don't know just rush in to support me when I'm in my absolute worst. So thank you, once more for being here for me. I mean it. I love you all",1

I can't think of any good reason why this is compleatly ignored when people discuss about this because it has had a huge effect on my life. I can't explain how awful it is when someone talks about stuff i've said or done and I can't properly remember it myself.

Edit: everyone probably doesn't have this and it's not an offical symptom of depression but it definitely is a side effect. Like some people have said it all just blurs together. I think it has something to do with how you don't really enjoy the stuff you do so you just go on and do things without thinking or registering them. I mean I can't remember most of my childhood or early teenage years so don't know what's that all about but it's kind of a relief that im not alone with this.

My family is saying I will "ruin Christmas" if I spend time with her in the hospital on Christmas Eve instead of visiting them. What can I do?,2390,0.99,"A good friend of mine with whom I've been attending therapy for BPD overdosed a couple days ago. She survived and was transported unconscious to the hospital. She woke up but is unsurprisingly devastated. I want to be there as her support, she has a boyfriend but no family members who care about her and few friends. I had plans to see my family for Christmas but when this happened, it left me deeply depressed, particularly because another good friend of mine had committed suicide four years ago almost on the same day. To elaborate, I don't like spending Christmas with my family. I like them, but Christmas has always been more about chores and preparations than about quiet and peace. 

I thought I would spend Christmas by visiting my friend in the hospital. I don't want her to be alone, I know that if I were in her situation I would appreciate it if someone came to visit me. So I proposed this to my mother and brother, even the possibility that I would spend the afternoon with her and then go down to see them before dinner. However, their comments left gasping for air. They showed little empathy for my friend or me. My mother asked me if I had any ""normal"" friends. My brother told me that while it's ultimately my choice, I would be ruining Christmas by not coming down, or even by coming down just for dinner, that everyone would be disappointed in me and it would create arguments, implying I would be at fault for them. 

Here's the breakdown:  with my family, I risk being ostracized for weeks if not months if I don't go down there. However, I've felt more and more like they were less and less my family, while I've felt like my friends have shown more compassion and empathy for my depression and BPD than my family ever has - in fact, they've dismissed it as me ""not having enough social activity"", as ""not having enough will"", and have called my therapy ""a waste of time."" I feel like visiting my friend is the right thing to do, I know I will think of her the whole time I would be down at my family's, but I do not want to be ostrasized for months. I don't think I could handle it with my mental condition.

I don’t actually want to die. Not really. I don’t think I want to experience the process of ending my life. I think I am just....terrified of existing. I have it good in my life right now, in terms of shelter and health. I don’t have a job but I am looking and I just need to find the right opportunity.

But life scares me. People scare me. Forming relationships terrifies me. Human interaction is a black hole. Doing the things I used to enjoy makes me want to puke. I get anxiety from READING recreationally. Loving people is scary. Loving myself, even moreso.

So what am I supposed to do, if I am literally terrified of existing? When existing feels painful? When the thought of existing outside of myself in a world full of people that could love me or hate me makes me want to die?

This upcoming September will be the 7th year I’ve been living here. During these 7 years, I have never gotten a chance to visit my family back home. My great grandmother passed away about 4 years ago and it pains me to this day, specially since I couldn’t attend her funeral because I’m in Canada. 

It is hard for me to speak to my family (I’m in a group chat with some of them), like I feel very awkward and I don’t know what to say to them or have conversation about, thus making me feel more alone and sadder than ever. I still sometimes cry every time I think about the happy life I had back then in Iran with family and friends around me, and knowing that those good times will never come back deeply hurt me. 

Not to mention, out of nearly 7 years of living here in Canada, I didn’t have a lot of friends (I have more online friends that irl friends, but I still only talk and play with a few of them) and I’ve always felt like I didn’t belong with them and couldn’t fit in. Although I feel alone, I’m still the emotional support friend in my friends group. It’s ironic, I can help others with my advice and care, but not myself. I feel really disconnected from everyone and everything. 

Nothing makes me happy anymore, I miss the feeling of love I got from family back home, and not only that’s missing, I’ve never had a chance to make good and happy memories here, either with the little amount of friends I have or with my parents, so it’s hard for me not to think about the past because I was much more happier then. I just feel very unimportant. I don’t really feel excited about college at all, I am going to pursue studying IT Programming but I’m not too sure if I’m gonna like it, I feel like I’m not gonna do good and fail. Not only fail at college, but also at life too, and I can’t handle being a failure. 

I just want to feel truly loved and cared for again, I don’t want to be alone with my overly pessimistic and negative thoughts. I always feel somewhat happy when I’m around my friends, but not as much as I was with friends in Iran, and when my friends go and I become alone again, the sadness and dark thoughts come back. 

I’ve had depression not too long ago, and I truly thought I beat my depression for good almost a year ago, but it came back, and I’ve been trying my hardest to fight it back by converting my sadness into anger,(I know, it’s still not a healthy or good method) but lately, my sadness became too much and it stopped turning into anger. I lack motivation to do anything, and I’m supposed to be preparing for college and also being able to get my full drivers license. 

Now I know that a lot of people here have gone through a lot worse, but everyone is different and have had different experiences. I am a very emotional and a big family man, and i can’t handle being away from family for this long and not being able to go back to at least visit them, and on top of that, barley having any friends, not fitting in, mostly left out of things and the stress and pressure of becoming a failure in life. I don’t know what to do :(",1

On the one hand, I'm the luckiest person I know. But on the other, it's caused me to not know how to live. I'm currently 31, I'ven ever truly held what I'd call a career moving job to job existing on natural skill and doing things the hard way rather than the smart way. After losing my job in February standing up to someone destroying his employees; it was the first time I lost a job I felt I actually worked hard to be good at. Don't get me wrong, it was security work. We're not talking anything special. I've done Bar, Customs, Military as well as own + owned a comic/hobby store. Only losing the first store to a bad partner got me like how losing this stupid security job did.

Big whoop right? Move on, find something else. One thing I couldn't abide was that I have no career. Throughout my life, I've eschewed higher education for the most part. I tried to do fashion design after school but dropped out being unenthused about both the people I was working with and eventually with the reasoning I was doing it. Recently, with the support of my partner; I enrolled into education as my partner and brother are both teachers and enjoy satisfaction at work. Both have mentioned I'm excellent with kids(I teach people in my store basic hobby stuff/painting). I am currently 5 weeks in via distance ed(thanks Covid) and I can't even concentrate. I load the page, start reading and panic, then procrastinate either doing nothing, or cleaning ineffectual. I feel too stupid to learn this.This is all squarely on me and I don't feel I can get anywhere.

This is whats most prominent. The problem is I feel like a leech. A person only here because of the grace of my family and people around me.

My partner and I have split up so many times. She's wonderful, a few pitfalls but nothing I blame her for. We nearly kill each other in our fights. She's told me she's proud of how patient I am. But these days, our fights have escalated, and quickly; to the point I I've grabbed her. I don't know who I am to do this; I'm one of the least violent people but now I'm seeing my only way out as it. To her credit, she's described it as not me. But I'm appalled at myself. We've seen a relationship advisor but I felt it did little. And now we're on a break since it's affecting both of our health. I often go for bouts of simply not eating.

As a result, I've moved home; I'm with my parents and infantalised. It's like most of my adult life they've stepped in to just throw money at problems or fix things for me instead of letting me learn.

I can't seem to stick to anything. I can't keep fit(thank god for the not eating parts of depression). I can't study. I can't seem to keep a normal job for more then a year or so. And I'm 31. I feel like a failure. And by definition I am. My old brother had 2 kids and a career at this point. And there's nothing wrong with him.

I've been to doctors, tried the drugs; they did nothing by make me cloudy. Tried the psych people. Was just 6 sessions of letting me talk and I'm sick of it. Nothing is helping. I feel like due to being raised in a silver spoon family as the youngest, I don't have a right to be here. That there are people born in abject poverty who can function better and deserve more then I do. I just feel like if I wasn't around I wouldn't be a burden on my parents, my friends. And especially my partner. I feel like I need to set her free permanently. She does better when I'm not there.

I feel like I'm at the point in life that I can't fix me. Everything I try does nothing. I can't concentrate. I can't do anything right. I don't finish projects out of anxiety. I contribute nothing. And honestly, for what I've done; I don't deserve to be here anyway. I'm the awful monstrous loser you warn your kids about. And if I can't fix it, it seems like the right thing to do is not be here anymore.",1
https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/hmpbda/thoughts_from_the_bathrub/,SuicideWatch,danbarnsjolo,1594132313,Thoughts from the bathrub,2,1,"*This post may be trigger emotions within self or of others, on the topic of mental welfare, wellness, and suicide.







Much of my life has been an uphill struggle, from family struggles, schooling life (changing schools, poor academic results) social obstacles, building relationships and friendships.

Often struggling to maintain longterm goals, and a willingness to see longterm.


I've just never felt I fit in, struggled to breach surface level friendships, struggled to find my place in this world and be comfortable in my own skin.


Since the early stages of my life I have always struggled with conflicts of not fitting in, not being able to compete with others around me, and what my place in this world is.


Happiness is something I have not truly lived And experienced, sure the fleeting moments of joy from a fulfilment of a thing, which only has short term relief.


The longing for feelings of connection, love, being wanted, contributing, having a safe place, companionship, family and joy are things that, sure, may exist, and I understand can be obtained, but seems to belong in a galaxy far far away...


Ponts in my life i have grasped at drawng cloaer the end of my life, to only sit and sob, or go to hosital for a break, or call a support line service, which doesnt seem to help.

Maybe its that we dont speak the same language, or that this abyss of emptiness is so deeply rooted I cannot come out.



I've tried (to my understanding) (and entered into with an open mind and heart) all the available options of support, ranging from:

Telephone support services

Walking/ outdoor physical groups

Social groups

Intellectual social groups

Calling friends

Starting newhobbies

Move house/ town

Stop bad habbits

Pharmacology relief

Hospital stays

Gettng an animal


This feeling seems far beyond my own scope to jump out from, the overwhelming feeling of being stuck down a well, and being unable to climb up, as I've exhausted all resources within reach.


I've been told things to my face like ""just snap out of it"", "" thats not normal thinking, so stop"", ""you have nothing to be depressed about"", ""just go for a walk"", ""i understand youre doing this for attention, and there are better ways of doing that"".

Believe me, i dont ever want to feel this way, nor would i ever want someone i dont like to live a life long journey of feeling outcast and not wanting to be alive.


Yesterday i reached a low point, a point of extreme sadness, a scary place that I would cry if somene i knew told me they did this.

I filled my bath up with water, cut an extension cord and grabbed a lamp, jumped in the bath, counted to 5 and put both under water, to my absolute disbelief and disappointment nothing happened...

A moment of sadness that nothing happened ran through me, i got out, checked the power box, flicked the safety and second attempt, again nothing.

I drove to kmart to buy a toaster and hair dryer to have a second crack, but driving home i felt weak and called work, went over to bosses house, where i shared and got a ride in an ambulance. To eventually return home an hour or two later, back to being alone in my unit, and back to the same place i was at before.


I've tried on previous occasions throughout my life to end my life, but never as close as I had last night, and never with the overwhelming resignation that this was a decision I wanted.


""But Dan, what about the people that you leave behind that will be hurt?""

I rebut with, but what about my life term suffering and pain?

And where have these people been throughout my day to day life, for the small and big.


""Suicide is a longterm fix for a short term problem""

I rebut with that these feelings have been traveling with my for the past many long years (decades).


I dont know why i share this with you, maybe you have felt things like this, or know someone in a similiar situation, maybe my story can be a reminder about something, and maybe I need to get it out.",1

I have a strange feeling I might have covid. I'm 18 and have been dealing with an undiagnosed lung issue since March of last year. I'm pretty sure it's chronic bronchitis but I'm not and can't be 100% sure unless I see a doctor. But whatever it is, I'm certain it will put me at high risk of mortality for covid. I hit my friends dab pen last Wednesday and later that same day he told me that one of his co-workers came in ""really sick"". Chances are his coworker had covid and had been coming to work with covid for God knows how long. Today I tried to go on my usual bike ride and couldn't finish it as I normally would. I got home and felt a lot more tired than usual even though I didn't go as far as I normally do.

Anyway, the main point of this is that if I do actually have it, I will not hesitate to end it. I've read plenty of stories of what being on a ventilator is like and what dealing with even a moderate case of the disease is like. Honestly, I'd much rather just get it over with than drag it out for weeks like that. Falling off of a bridge sounds way better to me than drowning in your own lung secretions.",1

I vividly remember having a great childhood with friends and playing with frogs and playing behind the forest next to my home. Even though I was a victim of racism during elementary school, I was still happy. Even though kids made fun of me for being not as well as off, I was still somewhat happy. I was an optimistic and bright kid who tried really hard in school and to please her parents. I had friends whom I tried to make happy and hang out with all the time. But I developed insomnia and academic stress and depression in my sophomore year of high school. I was tired of competing with toxic people who kept comparing test scores with me and the girls who bullied me at school. I couldn’t sleep properly at night and was a walking zombie at school. I thought my friends cared about me but they all turned away caring about their own futures. Everyone knew I was depressed but just ignored me or encouraged my suicide. So then I told myself that I just needed to wait until graduation and college would be better. Except I failed to get into the college I wanted to go to while my friends got in with scholarships. I was stuck at home living with my parents. I didn’t even have my own car because I had failed my driving test. So then I went to Korea to escape my depression and my parents who bitched at me all the time. I was young and naive and was sexually assaulted and almost roofied in a club in Korea. I developed PTSD as a result. I also dealt with my abusive and bipolar grandma who told me to die. When I came back from Korea, I started getting sick really badly. I would throw up in the bathroom during lectures and my mom would yell at me because she thought I was making it up. I eventually stopped attending classes. So then I decided to go back to my old church. But the people there called me selfish for being suicidal. In addition, I had to face my bullies who had bullied me when I was a kid there. I still remember their look of disgust. It added to my PTSD. Then I would meet guys because I got lonely but they took advantage of me obviously because they were fuckbois. I got more sexually assaulted and got more PTSD. Guys would send me nasty and inappropriate messages online and ask for pictures and after I didn’t, they blocked me. It made me cry for some reason, knowing that shitty people exist in this world to take advantage of me. The few guys who did take me seriously, ghosted me soon after they found out I was suicidal. They’re a bunch of fucktards. Oh yeah my aunt told me it was my fault I couldn’t relate to other people when I said I was suicidal. My other aunt said I need to read the Bible more properly after I told her I cut my wrist. I want to transfer to another school but I don’t have the money. I secretly don’t want to go back to my old school because it’s a piece of shit. But my mom threatened to kill me if I don’t. I wish she would actually fulfill her promise. My parents are a bunch of religious nuts and forced me to go to church when I was a kid. Honestly, I’m afraid that I might go to hell so I’m holding back on committing suicide. But these days, I think it’s a load of bullshit. Fuck life. It’s only sadistic to force someone to live if they have too much pain. These days, I just lightly cut my wrist whenever something happens like my mom bitching at me or my PTSD acting up again. Also, America’s mental health system is a fucking joke. I went to the crisis center, where the staff just made me feel like I was a liability for being suicidal. I went to the hospital where I was stuck in the hallway for seven hours. I went to a psychiatrist who was a complete bitch and should be fired from working as a licensed medical professional. I went to a therapist who just told me to find a hobby. Well no shit everything is fucking boring. Now I just take meds which aren’t even strong enough. People are like omg you’ve been through so much, I’m here for you blah blah blah. 
I get it, it was heartwarming at first but now I’m tired of hearing it. Seeing you live your life successfully doesn’t make me feel better.

I was addicted to oxycodone for months and he knew that and still he told me constantly that he wanted to buy oxy and do it with me. after weeks of saying no, I caved and accepted. he mentioned that in his text to me today saying I used him and offered him head for handouts. gave me the whole spiel of ""being numb"" and saying he never felt love towards me in the first place.

It's over for me.",1,1,"Hi. I don't know how to start this. I don't want to sound like I'm playing the victim or like I want pity. Anyways.
I'm actually considering ending everything. 
My dad was abusive (psychically, emotionally and financially) all along my early childhood until now, especially to my mom. He groomed me in weird ways that I don't know how to explain when I was a little girl and s**ual abuse has always being suspected but never confirmed due to not being able to remember anything from when I was young. 
My mom is a wonderful person in a lot of ways: she's smart, a good teacher and knows a lot about different topics, but performs poorly as a mother. She never really teach how to love myself, didn't teach correct basic hygiene, didn't teach how to have a healthy relation with food, but the worst is how she never defended me from my father or from my abusive grandma (her mother, I will talk about her too). She has always used gaslighting against me and has been overly demanding/strict with me: perfect grades, perfect body, don't complain, etc etc. She usually mocks my interests when we fight or belittles my efforts in areas that she doesn't see as useful.
My grandma is the person I hate the most: she took care of me when I was a child while my mom worked, and despite everything I will always be thankful of that, I was at that time and that's why I never gave major problems (tantrums and such). Since I was a girl she belittles me everyday, demands me to do anything she wants 24/7 and insults me if I don't, won't allow me to have friends or a partner, won't allow me to go out of the house for more than a couple of hours. She teared my self esteem apart, using my bad relationship with my parents against me and painting me as the responsible for my father's abusive behavior. When I was a younger she used to yank my hair and used to threatening to hit me everyday.
Another member of my family is my younger (she's 17, I'm almost 20) sister. She has severe autism, imagine it as a normal looking girl but with the mind of a baby (8 months-1 year at max). She cries and screams everyday for at least 8 hours (sometimes at night), shits and pees everywhere, hits me (she's taller and stronger than me), destroys everything in the house, etc. She doesn't speak and either understands language. I've been taking care of her since always, but with more responsibility every year. I understand that my mom works and my grandma is old, but still, my body and my mind can't cope anymore.

On the other hand, I've suffered from eating disorders since I was 11-12 years old. 8 years fighting against purging, binging, starving, exercising like a madman, and repeat. This is tied to my depression that started to worsen around that age too (it was always present though, I remember writing suicide notes to my mom when I was 6, and going to sleep crying every night), along with social anxiety. I was diagnosed with all of that when I was 13, but my psychiatrist was poorly educated with anything to do with teens so the 3 months of therapy didn't work at all for me (this is the only therapy I ever received). Since then my grades started to slip and I graduated as one of the worst of my generation at school, leaving me with almost no possibilities to go to a good University in my country.

I also have Ehlers Danlos syndrome, which leaves me in pain everyday, getting worse as time passes. My joints are getting weaker and weaker, my feet hurt as I walk and my neck is so stiff I can barely sleep at night.

Now in the current time, I have been taking care of my grandma, my sister and the house almost at full time since I was 16. When I hit 18 and graduated school (and failed my University applications) I have been totally isolated from my friends and have dedicated all of my time to house chores. It's been 16-17 months since that. Sometimes my friends send me a message like once a month, I don't know what I did to deserve them tbh. I miss them everyday, and wonder if they are doing fine, but I have barely the strength to wake up.

Everyday is the same: clean, do laundry, grocery shopping, and so on.

 I don't have motivation anymore. I been trying, really. I have spent hours and hours for years reading tips, books, watching conferences about psychology. But I don't know what to do anymore. I don't have friends, I don't have a partner, I can barely talk to my mom or grandma without ending up fighting. I don't even know how to eat without binging (since june I've been in a restrictive cycle of anorexia). I don't have money, and I can't get a job because I have to take care of the house. I can't go out. I'm trapped, and I only see one exit

I know that there's people in situations much worse than mine, I'm grateful for what God has given to me.  But I think it's over. As soon as quarantines are over I think I will jump of the highest building I can find and end everything. I don't want to feel this pain anymore.

The past 4 years I have been my worst enemy. Destroying relationships, doing drugs, kicking myself in the ass. Every day I wake up with 3 minutes of peace, then my brain starts screaming at me. Nonstop. EVERYTHING I've done, every mistake, every missed opportunity, my brain remembers. It punishes me. Every day. Every day. EVERY DAY. I tried exercising. I said yes to new experiences. I tried making things right with people in my past. It feels so pointless. Why can I not simply forgive myself for my mistakes? I will never know. Why can't I find inner peace? Dunno. How can I despise who I am when I'm all I have. I will never know. How come I push away the people who are closest? Because I know what's coming. Deep down I know how my story ends. It ends with me fighting my brain. My brain will win. Why would I want anyone I love get close to me when I know what comes next. That, my friends, is why I now know I can't go on. I will not plan it. I will not make a big deal out of it. One day, it's just going to happen. To any of my friends who eventually read this, I love you guys. Without you, I wouldn't have made it past my 1st semester of college. To my mom, you are the most awesome mother I could have ever asked for. You will never understand how much you helped me. I know I wasn't the best son but you are the best mom. To my brothers, You guys are so much stronger than me, I'm sorry you only had me to look up to. I'm sorry for pushing you guys away all these years, I love all of you. To anyone else in my past I have wronged, I want to sincerely apologize for being who I was. I was an ass, addict, passive aggressive, jealous, loser. 

I want you all to know that if I could do everything in my life over, I would. I would do every single thing differently. Everything. Unfortunately for me, there is no restart option, only a game over. I want everyone to know that, if life does go on after all this shit, I'll do better next time. I promise. I love you all.

People talk about how they can envision themselves at different points in their life(graduation, wedding, job, kids) but I’ve never been able to do that. The only thing I see is me walking across a college campus with books in my arm and my hair is in a ponytail and I have a backpack on. I don’t know why I can’t really “see” myself past that point. I’ve told other people about it and I’ve gotten responses from same to seek help. I just don’t know how I can make my mind think I’m going to live past 19. I’ve struggled with major depression and general anxiety for years(found out recently) but even when that stuff comes in waves the expectation date is always there. I’ve come close to attempting suicide before, didn’t go through, but I don’t know that I won’t just go and off myself. Usually I can ignore the general feeling like my time is running out but recently it’s been in my thoughts a lot more

Thinking about the medications I stopped taking and how easy it would be to overdose on them.
Thinking about how I benefit to those closest to me, wondering still why I'm not good enough for those I love most. 

I'm stuck in the whirlpool of my thoughts and all it does is suck me in deeper. 
Maybe I messed up too many times, or maybe I just am someone nobody can even get close to. 
Maybe I deserve what's happening, that's my best excuse for it.

If I let myself sink deeper into dissociation, will things get better or will I take a step off the ledge and fall to my utter demise.

Maybe it's best I weren't here. Everyone else sure seems to think so.",1

She verbally rips me to absolute shreds on a daily basis, and drinks so much that she's lost several jobs (including childcare) due to being drunk on the job. I am only 20 so I am not living with her by choice, but by need, and that I wanted to take care of her.

I am an absolute shell of a man. I have been told to kill myself so many times throughout my life it's not even funny, people always say I'd be doing myself a favor. So I isolated myself from these people until I only had one person left, the one person I thought I could depend on; my mom.

She's been in and out of rehab well over ten times and eventually her family decided to just frame me, her son, for a crime I didn't commit and got us kicked out of my grandparents house at age 18, homeless, still in high school. Then my mom became the worst bully, because she's the only person who's opinion I've ever actually really cared about.

After one of the worst years of my life, it just gets exponentially worse. This year I was held hostage and tortured by my own boss. This year one of my friends died (only 20) and several are homeless due to obvious financial complications. This year I lost almost $4000 due to a previous employer screwing me over and of course I can't afford to take legal action. That could have finally bought me another car - oh, did I mention my other one got stolen?

Drugs. I wake up with my heart pounding out of my chest. I need a Xanax. I scramble for my dresser. I need a Xanax. I open the drawer and take the xanax. Now I need a morphine, a bowl and a cigarette. Drugs. The only things that have kept me insane enough to stay alive through all of this.

I'm finally done. I have everything I need for a painless death finally and I'm getting off of this God forsaken earth as soon as fucking possible. She always makes fun of me and mocks me when I cry and beg her to stop drinking, so maybe she'll finally realize what she's put me through.

Shame is I actually had potential before. I scored a clean 29 on the ACTs and had an IQ of 133 (for whatever that's worth nowadays). My dream was to become a scientist and research new treatments for debilitating mental illnesses like the myriad I suffer from. That was back when I was normal.

I am no longer. I am a sub-human piece of garbage. I don't know what I did in my previous life to deserve constant agony and NOBODY to help me through it. I'm tired of living my life for other people.

I’m not to focused on labels so please don’t give me the whole, “oh labels shouldn’t define you” speech. I just want to really know what’s wrong so I can fix it. (Best treat it). In reality though I know that won’t change a damn thing, I just want to die, so so so very badly. It won’t leave my head and everyday I prove to myself that I really cannot get along in this world. I overly sensitive, weak minded, have no back bone, have commitment issues, am a horrible son, friend, grandson, cousin, brother, along with many other things. I hate myself so very much and I constantly have these mood swings where I completely forget/am in denial, of the truth, I go around my family and get them more and more attached to me like a stupid, selfish piece of shit.

When I know it’s only a matter of time before I off myself. I’m so tired, I just want to die, and the only thing keeping me here is that I do not want to hurt anyone. It is so terrible that you are given a life that you don’t even want and yet there are people who you care about that basically force you to stay alive with the very same life that they did not ask for.

This world is nothing but shit, suffering, and then we die. I wish I could stop caring about the ones I care about so I could just end it. The worst part is that the problem with ending it is that it’s a selfish decision that makes me feel horrible for even asking, but staying alive and going around my loved ones is equally as selfish.

Every day I get up and get dressed, grab my lunch, and leave for work. I sit at a desk for 8 hours in silence. I get my shit done. I help other people get their shit done. I get zero recognition. I get zero appreciation. I come home and cook dinner for a husband who was home all day. I do the dishes. I shower and I lay down and scroll thru my phone until I'm tired. I do it all over again the next day. 

What is the point of any of this?

Covid helped me blow thru half my savings. My paychecks barely cover my bills and other expenses. We are a one income home for the time being. Luckily we have no children to support right now. 

Maybe there is no point. 

My first husband died in a work accident. I often wish it had been me. If I was gone and he was here I wouldnt have had years of court to get to the bottom of his cause of death. I wouldnt have been outcast by his greedy family. I wouldnt feel the undeniable presence of survivors guilt everytime I look at his box of ashes. 

Yeah, i dont think there is a point. 

My second husband's family has a lot of drama. I get mixed up in it often. I try my best to not stir the pot. But with such a monotonous life it's hard to not relish the entertainment. And maybe that's my fault, but I'm okay with that. I feel like the issues will always be there and I just have to deal with it because it will never change. I'm just having a bad day and I dont care to elaborate more for fear of someone seeing this post and then using it against me. 

So here is my point...

If I am no longer here I no longer deal with the pain. I dont have the pressure or anger or blame. If I am gone my husband gets a nice paid day from my life insurance policy. He wouldnt have to worry. Our families would eventually move on with their lives. Thank god we dont have children yet, because how would you explain to a baby that mommy just cant deal with it anymore. I care more about setting someone up financially than to care about myself. The therapists are too expensive and the vent sessions just leave friends feeling more pity than anything. I guess what I mean is I feel like a burden because ""someone always has it worse"" and i will never be that someone apparently. I just dont care anymore. I dont plan to die or cause my death, but u have definitely thought about it. More often than i will admit.

I've struggled with my mental health since my teens, and have isolated myself pretty extensively for about ten years now. My mother died five years ago, and that just made things worse. I've pushed people away, and basically thought that no one wanted me around or even liked me. Last night though, I came home and my sister, aunt, and uncle had decorated our house and bought a cake for my birthday.

It's the first real acknowledgment I've had of my birthday since my mother died, and it felt so nice to be remembered and to feel like I was actually wanted. It's really given me a new perspective on things. It made me realize that even though I've locked myself away in my mind and convinced myself that I'm alone, I *do* matter to other people and they want me to be happy. I'm going to do my best to remember that and work towards improving my mental health.",0

Understanding how I was broken finally allowed me to heal. Now, at 40 years old, I've finally repaired myself, my credit, and made enough in savings, to strike out and buy my first house. No shared walls with neighbors, and no family handouts to get here. 

Deal is signed as of today, legally enforceable. Not a big place, but it's waterfront with trails, beside a park. I've done SO much work helping others build and upgrade their homes as a way to scrape by. For the first time in my life, I will finally have a place to make my own.

**Happiest Love Story (told happily)**

&#x200B;

>**Eliwood x Ninian** personally. Spoilers for pretty much all of FE7 ahead. (also this is an incredibly long post, got kinda carried away...)  
>  
>Say what you will about FE7’s story, but I think this romance was done quite well. It’s not instantly forced like far too many romances in fiction are. Their first meeting is in Kyn mode where Leiwood rescues her and that’s it. No stupid love at first sight on Eliwood’s part or obsessiveness over her saviour on Ninian’s part, Eliwood just rescued someone he felt was in danger.  
>  
>Then when they reunite in Eliwood mode again it’s still not incredibly in your face. You can tell Eliwood cares a great deal about Ninian, but he also cares a lot about Hector & the rest of his friends.  
>  
>As the story progresses they start incorporating little scene between the two that act almost like a second set of support conversations. Eliwood is portrayed in all his virtuous dorkiness which allows Ninian to open up to him, seeing him wear his heart of his sleeve make shed realise there’s nothing to fear about being more open with people, yet she still makes an effort to stay detached from Eliwood & co knowing what she is and what that means for a human relationship. In time she can’t help but grow attached to everyone, especially Eliwood and then that’s where the big moment comes in.  
>  
>When Durandal causes Eliwood to kill Ninian that’s the moment they both realise just how much they mean to eachother. Eliwood realises Ninian isn’t just another one of his friends with the power of friendship and all that, and Ninian realises just how attached she’s become to Eliwood & his party. It’s a tragic end to a love story between 2 people who just can’t seem to express their feelings (either due to pureness or shyness/fear) until its too late.  
>  
>But then Brammimond f’ed it up and gave us this stupid cheesy happy ending. More on this part later but let it be known I hate it. The split between Ninian’s choosing to leave through the gate to protect herself and her friends or to stay even when her brother is leaving does a great job of enrapturing Ninain’s development (or lack thereof)  
>  
>If they don’t have an A support and Ninian leaves, it means she believes she really just can’t coexist with human even if it means departing the one she loves. She remains steadfast in her initial fear of the damage and tragedy she could cause and decides to ahed her ties with Eliwood for the better of both herself and the humans.  
>  
>If they do have an A support, then Ninian decides to take a chance and stay with Eliwood, knowing that no matter what may come that they’ll be able to deal with it together. She forgoes staying with her brother, the only person she was able to confide in and share her life with, which signifies that now she feels able to open up to Eliwood and co and face her fears together. It’s bit cheesy but a nice conculsion to Ninian’s character.  
>  
>the big issues I have with Eliwood x Ninian are two things: the forced happy ending & the weird canon/not canon line it treads on. While Ninian being revived does make way for one of her best moments, her final choice it also reduces the worth of her original death scene and what that meant for her & Elwiood’s characters. It seems like the writers both wanted their powerful tragedy and happy ending at the same time.  
>  
>Then there’s the weird thing they do where Eliwood x Ninian is entirely canon, but so heavily pushed towards the player. It’s the only paring that changes a significant part of the story (Ninian‘a decision) and again, those pseudo-support moments, yet the writers arbitrarily restrict themselves by allowing Eliwood to be paired with someone else, which creates this weird ocntradiction where Eliwood x Ninian is built up so much in the story but then is cast aside because the player chose a different pairing.  
>  
>All in all, it’s not perfect, but I think it’s a great attempt at actually incorperating a love story into the main story. It’s been done better in other places, but not in FE. u/Cosmic_Toad_

&#x200B;

>love of the non-romantic kind: **Eirika and Ephraim.**  
>  
>I cant speak for how everyone felt, but these two really did feel like actual siblings. Sibling teams arent a new thing for FE, but this was the first time two siblings shared equal billing in a games story (and frankly the only time where the game handled multiple lords equally). I love their relationship and it remains one of the strongest games in the series imo.

&#x200B;

>**Eliwood x Ninian** is the most prevleant, but FE4 Sigurd x Deidre (And subsequent Deirdre x Arvis ) has the largest impact on the events in the story. u/Cosmic_Toad_

&#x200B;

>**Nyna and Camus** are pretty important to the narrative of the Archanea games.  
>  
>Alm and Celica, and Sigurd and Deirdre also come to mind. The problem is that after these games romantic pairings tend to become less and less canonical, so it’s difficult to answer the question.

&#x200B;

>**alm and celica** is the only nkn-tragic love story integral to the plot. gives me fuzzy feelings. i like it a lot. u/ZealousRadiance

&#x200B;

>**FE7 and Echoes** have love stories spanning the entire game and FE7 has supports that can lead to additional romances.  
>  
>**Awakening** technically has alot of love but because each character usually has 5 plus romantic interests...it sorta makes it feel like the Shepards are just willing to do anything with two legs and of the opposite sex rather than any genuine bond, you can only have so many love interests per character before you start wondering if they'd just say yes to anyone, there's no actual love in the story, it's mostly just support dialogue and again, personally the large amount of options just doesn't actually make it seem like these are real romances. u/Samz707

&#x200B;

Imapct on overall narrative (didn't ask about this)

>While it doesn't take the biggest chunk of the screentime, the Sigurd/Deirdre part of FE4 has the biggest impact on the narrative by far in the entire series. Otherwise, my favorite couple is probably Marth and Caeda (Very surprising, I know). They just have a really nice dynamic, and though they're already in love (rather than fall in love over the story), it's super believable that they care deeply for one another.

&#x200B;

>Echoes feel this one just has the strongest overall tie to the whole story. While Sigurd and Deirdre is very involved in the events leading to the tragedy of the first part of Genealogy, Echoes spends the whole game working through Alm and Celica's relationship. The game literally starts with the near-beginning of their relationship as kids, and then spends the first two acts just building up to their reunion. Naturally, it can't be concluded there due to their falling-out, which conveniently lines up with the fact that there's still a lot more to be done in the story. Through their time apart from each other they learn all the more just how important to each other they are, and when they finally get a small chance to talk again (though not truly together) they've grown even closer. Of course, the game ends with them finally reuniting as one after many struggles to defeat Duma, and this time staying together for the long run. In that essence I feel Echoes is more of a love story than any other FE game can claim to be. u/icrawfish7

Wifey was on the phone so I took the parcel.

In those two seconds I noted it has my wifey's name on and the parcel had tell tale pictures and information on the box to know it is a piece of hobby equipment I have wanted for a few years but have never been able to justify getting.

She's patiently listened to me chat about it from time to time and I always talk myself out of getting one as I can't justify the triple figure cost for my hobby.

In that brief moment, I heard my daughter shout out as the dog accidentally knocked her over when she rushed past to greet the postman.

I took advantage of that to quickly drop it down, say thanks to the postman, rush away and comfort our daughter who was not really hurt at all.

Wifey finished her call and shouted upstairs if all was well. I said our daughter had a bump and shouted back ""she got knocked down by the dog so I'm checking she is okay. Can you sort the parcel? I just had to throw it down and run up here.""

I peaked from upstairs, saw her pick it up, sigh with relief, smile, wrap it up in a bag and take it away to hide it.

She shouted back that it was a seat cover for the garden chair and I've been happily appreciating her since. She never makes a big birthday fuss and usually forgets so I'm so incredibly touched. I won't need to practice being happy and surprised in a month as I'm so excited.

I'm really happy that circumstances meant I could cover up that I found out.

I dropped a ""we need to step back from ordering house stuff, we're getting too many parcels"" an hour or so later and she half smiled before saying she'll try and cut down with a sparkle in her eye.

Mental and physical health and a bad environment, and it is still a process to heal. But that is not the point of the story.

My two best friends are inside my apartment. One who I love more than anything in every possible way, sleeping, safe and happy after a long drive to see me. The other, playing her favorite game, relaxing after a long day, who I love just as much, but not in the same way.

I was not ready for sleep, so I made a bowl of ramen, went to my driveway and sat on my old desk that is waiting to find a new home, and let the moonlight infuse every pore and cell of me with peace. I turned on music that sounds like night and faeries, but the kind that slip past you as you doze away, putting your meds in a slightly more visible place and pulling your covers over your bare shoulder as you are leaving the waking realm.

Sitting here, with my ramen and the moon and the stars and my music, I felt like I had entered a life that could only be the 3 am animal crossing experience in our world. That sense that everything was right - that though the world is big and scary and painful right now, that it will turn out alright... That something, if not someone, is looking out for us, wants us to succeed 

I realized that the crises of faith I had been having - I had time to work those out at my own pace. And really, if my gods and goddess existed and I turned away from them, they would love me no matter what and still send what guidance they could. And if they didn't exist and I chose to believe in them, to make them real for me, the universe would give to me what it could.

But most of all, I realized that for the first time in many years, I was safe, secure, and happy all at once. That even if I knew the aftertaste when it passed would be bittersweet it would come again. That I could love myself, that people loved me, that I could be my authentic self and that I was a good person and could even be an extraordinary one. That I was secure, that I was safe, that I was happy; all at once. 

It's a lot to process, to be sure. But maybe that's why I knew I needed the moonlight - to remind myself to be soft and gentle and kind, to provide myself with rest after a long day of being a sun, I could be a moon to the world that is me.

We Shevardnadze a pretty long driveway and we just say we’re walking up and down that but really we’re going into the neighbor hood and walking around. We talk about random things when we’re outside at night, I like talking about things that don’t really matter because they make life feel so simple and fun. We can make jokes so easily without thinking, the ones that take years to forget. 

Another thing I like about it is how free you feel when you look up at the stars in the sky and think about how small you are. But you never think too much about it otherwise it gets a bit depressing… you just keep on talking about nice and simple stuff. It’s kind of windy at night, no people around so it also reminds me of the feeling of camping, being away from others. We walk and never stop but it feels as if my legs would never get tired, like I could walk forever but I don’t want to worry my parents and neither does my brother so we go back to the house always.

The rules were relatively simple. We would play a round of Super Smash Bros Melee to determine who would pick a number from a bowl, which corresponded to an ingredient. They were randomly numbered.

Eventually we got all of our ingredients assembled, and my god the smell was terrible. One sip was plenty for each of us. It was bad. Anyway, I thought I’d share this because it made me happy.

I’ve been patiently searching for the man for me. I don’t believe in “the one” but I want someone compatible with me that I’m attracted to. I want to be smart about who I date because I want the best chance for my next serious relationship to succeed.

I met him a month ago off a dating app. I wasn’t expecting much, it was just another date to me. First dates have become tedious honestly. I ended up enjoying our first dates together though. Every time I see him, I become more and more into him. Superficially he’s very attractive to me and definitely my type. He works out which is great because I like to work out too. He’s intelligent (an engineer). He’s only been in the U.S. for 3 years (he’s from another country) and his English is really good already. We rarely have problems communicating to the point where I forget sometimes that he’s not actually American despite his accent. He’s ambitious. We have a similar sense of humor. We can openly talk about personal things about ourselves. We can talk about almost anything. We can just walk around somewhere or be sitting around and have something to talk about. He’s actually interested in the things I say no matter how random. And I’m interested in the things he has to tell me. His viewpoints on interpersonal and romantic relationships is similar to mine. He agrees that communication is important (this is so important to me). And he has been just so sweet and gentlemanly to me. He cooks for me, gives me massages, opens doors for me, always makes sure I’m not hungry or thirsty, etc. I of course return the favor whenever I can. He’s the perfect balance of being attentive and caring towards me but also being independent (he’s not clingy).

Some of the most impressive things he’s done are how he has dealt with my unexpected health issues. I’ve been unable to wear makeup with him a few times due to an allergic reaction. I even showed up to a date once with swollen eyelids and rashes around my eyes. I looked terrible but he was very sweet and told me it wasn’t that bad. He tells me I look great without makeup. And we’ve only been dating for a month! I don’t usually get so comfortable with my bare face this early on. He makes me feel safe when I’m with him. Once of my exes was judgmental about how I looked so I know what it’s like to date someone who doesn’t make you feel comfortable in your own skin.

Another time, I was having severe pain and he held his hand on me to comfort me for the entire 30min while driving me home and kept looking over at me to make sure I was ok. It was embarrassing for me to have to show him this side of me but it really showed me how caring he is. He even texted me later after dropping me off to ask if I was ok.

He’s always down to do whatever I suggest. I surprised him with an escape room date and he loved it. I’ve suggested different date ideas and he’s always willing to try them out with me and makes them super fun. I’ve dated guys before who would scoff at and shoot down certain date ideas so this is very refreshing.

To be honest, I can’t see anything wrong with him. I know it’s been a month so I’m just barely touching the surface of him and of our relationship. I just can’t wait to get to know him more and I’m so happy to have met him. It’s the early stages and I’m trying to be realistic that the relationship could not be what I’ve hoped for and could very well end. It’s going well so far though and I’m optimistic!

Thanks for reading, if anyone is reading this. I hope you’re doing well and staying safe. :)",0

So, I met Devon prior, but we never really spoke until early January. It was her birthday and we were both stuck at work with not much to do. We spent the day playing a silly card game, throwing pens at each other, and just generally getting to know each other. 

She mentioned not really having any plans for her birthday and invited me out for drinks. I knew we had an instant connection and I wanted so badly to say yes, but I was recently out of a marriage and just wasn't ready to get into anything new. So I said no to her. Three. Times.

A week or two passes and I'm at work again. I get a phone call asking for help with a program that I'm in charge of and I need to go to our other location. I show up and low and behold it was her that needed my help. Now, this location usually doesn't have any people in it, so after we finish with what we were working on, we decide to skate for a bit and just hang out. The connection we had was natural, unforced, and completely undeniable after that day.

Another week passes though.

I'm sitting on my couch in my underwear, drinking a few beers when I decide to scroll some facebook. I notice I had a pending chat request from 4 days prior from Devon. I reply to her, apologize profusely for informing her message. Then she puts herself out there again and asks to meet up.

Y'all, I turned this woman down THREE TIMES on her birthday. Never reached out to her. Ignored her message for four days. And she still just wanted to get to know me.

I, of course, said yes this time.

A few weeks after that, everything was still going great, and she was looking for a new place to stay. In a move we both knew was crazy, we moved in together after barely a month together.

Ten months later, we took a trip to see her family and were planning to go to Disney. I also planned on asking her to marry me. We had talked about marriage and she even picked out a few rings. I made it three thousand miles with the ring with no issues at all.

We had a nightmare trying to get a rental car. We landed at 2am and even though we had a reservation, there were no cars available. So we Uber to her dad's house and get a car in the morning. We load up in the rental and start driving to Disney. A half hour into the drive, I'm filled with anxiety and realize my dumb ass forgot the ring at her dad's. We went back and got it, and drove to our hotel near Disney. Our plan was to carpool with her grandmother to save a bit of money, so that night, we drop off the car at an unmanned return center with a drop box for the keys.

I swear to you, the minute I heard the keys hit the bottom of the box, I knew I had fucked up. The ring was still in the car. After an hour of terrible customer service from the rental company, we finally get a locksmith to come open the car for us. While we wait on the locksmith, she jokingly says ""you should probably just give me the ring, that way you can't lose it again."" Well, the locksmith arrives and opens the car. In a move that would make the director of Oceans Eleven jealous, I pickpocket her phone and open the camera app and pass it off to the locksmith. I told him I needed a favor when I gave him the phone. I drop to one knee and ask the love of my life to marry me. Not gonna lie, I thought she might say no, just as payback for me turning her down on her birthday. My heart fills with joy as she says yes, genuinely surprised that I actually followed through with her joke. I'm sitting there basking in the moment when I hear ""oh shit! I didn't get it! I wasn't ready!"" In my move that was I was so proud of, I forgot to hit record on the phone.

Sooooo, we do a retake, this time smiling and laughing during the proposal, all while the car alarm is going off behind us.

That's the story of how I met and proposed to my beautiful, amazing wife. Our wedding was just as perfectly imperfect as the rest of the story (officiant said the wrong names, round two of me forgetting the ring, and all after COVID changed our plans multiple times) but I'm running out of time to type it all out.

I couldn't possibly be happier to have such an wonderful partner and I thought in a time where all seems bleak in the world, y'all could benefit from a smile or two.",0

So I (28m) just got accepted into doing a tertiary preparation program (TPP) and I'm pretty excited to start a new chapter in my life.

A bit of a back story on myself, I quit highschool when I was in year 10 and decided to start working full-time as I thought school wasn't for me. I did 3 years of an apprenticeship but never finished it and then when I was 18 I moved out of home and started working on drilling rigs (absolutely love working on the rigs been working on them for 10 years, but I don't want to end up being 60 years old, burnt out and nihilistic like some of the company men I've worked with).

In that time I got married and then fell victim to the oilfield when it comes to relationships and ended up getting divorced at 26, then just kind of floated in the patch working and living my life with no real direction. Spending my hard earned money on frivolous things, getting drunk, doing drugs, partying etc. Then covid happened, I lost my job and have kind of just been floating again no real direction.

Until last week I got a phone call from my mum (love her) and she said she has been thinking a lot about me and thinks I should go to uni and gain some more direction in life and put my ""brain"" to good use. I've spoken with her before about it but was always hesitant due to finances after loosing my job. She then went out and did all the research she could and found out that there is this (TPP) that is absolutely free and with the right grades can get automatic acceptance into the course of my choice through said uni (Australia has its perks I guess). Anyway I did a bit of research after her initial information hunt and applied for the TPP.

I checked my emails today and discovered that they accepted my application and am now enrolled into the program. Although this is way out of my comfort zone I'm actually really excited and happy that not only can I move toward making one of my dreams come true but also happy that my mother gave me this push and believes in me so much.

Tl:Dr Got accepted to start a Tertiary Preparation Program so I can eventually go to University, have a mother that believes in me and am looking forward to starting a new chapter in my life.",0

I have tried every way that these ""x ways to make money online"" sites say, but my English level is not that good, so I am currently trying to improve it, but it's still a huge burden and also I haven't studied a specialty that allows me to work only through internet. Anyway, I recently discovered the [r/slavelabour](https://www.reddit.com/r/slavelabour/). It has all sorts of tasks for low prices no matter how weird they are. So, I have many international friends and I like studying cultures and history as a hobby, also we like mocking each other's nation and culture all the time. So the idea came and I posted ""I will make jokes about every nation you ask me, 1$ per joke"". So a guy asked me for five. Before I reply to him, I checked his profile and he was Texan, so I started reading Texan history and stereotypes for an hour, and I came out with 5 jokes about US, 3 of them included Texas. But he eventually wanted Mexico. Due to the fact that I used to study Spanish, it wasn't that hard. I also checked some history of Mexico and I quickly came out with 5(I kind of cheated though, because I made one about Colombian stereotypes, but that's a secret). He liked them so much that he also gave me 5 dollars tip. I know that it's not much, but it was a really important small step forward. I have been in plenty of jobs, but I have never been so happy for earning so little money. It was a small sparkle of light in the darkness of my desperation. Thank you for reading this.",0

When I was 20 years old, I was squatting in an attic reminiscent of Harry Potter's broom closet, heavily drinking, and enormously depressed. Around that time, I made the decision to clean my life up and to start over. I set a list of goals for what I wanted my life to look like at 30: find a girlfriend, get married, get a degree, make 100k per year, gain 50 pounds (At the time, I was 6 feet tall, 130 pounds)

As of today, I'm 29 years old. I have been married to the love of my life for 5 years, I have both a bachelors and a masters' degree, I'm 175 pounds of muscle, and I was promoted today into my dream role making $98K per year.

Thank god for hard work, dedication, and the support of those I love and who love me.

My girlfriend and I met on r4r back in late May 2019. We both lived fairly near each other, but were a little weary about meeting in person- so we started talking via discord video chat. I went on a trip to Japan about a week after starting to talk to her (to celebrate my college graduation), but still made sure to text her every day, and she, being the wonderful, amazing person she is, even through a 13 hour timezone difference, alwas was sure to text me back. We arranged to meet in person the day after i returned home, and went on a lovely first date to a lantern festival in our local city. It was a bit awkward  especially since i didnt even know how to go about trying to hold her hand, but it went well enough that we went out again the next day.

And the day after.

And the day after.

After a week of dating nearly every day, we became official. 6 months later, and spending all my free time after work with her, I moved out and into an apartment (unofficially but officially) with her. We have spent almost every day with each other, and our anniversary is tomorrow...

Well, we both went into a store together to take turns in the card aisle. Guess who ended up buying the same cards for each other?

You guys, it finally happened!!",10,1,"I've been in love with this guy for years. We've been friends on and off - usually a kiss will send us separate ways for one reason or another (immaturity, guilty feelings, etc).

He popped up in my DMs about a week ago saying he was moving. I was kinda upset because obviously I was gonna *eventually* tell him how I felt, you know how it goes. We hung out. Turns out he's only moving to our old hometown 1.5 hours away, which isn't bad at all. We had a great time hanging out, and in his words, ""didn't miss a beat.""

Well I decided to go home today to see my dad for Father's Day since I can't this Sunday. After I saw him, I texted mah boi to see if he was free. He was.

Again, didn't miss a beat, laughs were had, and *man* have I missed this guy! Then he randomly tells me he's on Bumble before changing the subject. I was driving us to Sonic and couldn't fully respond, much less process what in the world he was trying to say. Before I left, I asked him what he was doing on there and he told me what he was looking for - all qualities in a person *that I have.* (I felt super great about that, ngl, but in the moment couldn't find a smooth way to be like B YOU'RE LOOKIN AT HER.)

As the evening was coming to a close and I was about to leave, he walked me out to the car. I turned around because I wanted to tell him how much *I* wanted him. Please, don't date someone else. I was begging, but couldn't get the words out. He mentioned something I barely heard and I told him he needed to be a bit more wild (in retort to whatever it was he said). He looked at me and said, ""oh don't worry. I will."" I laughed, and hugged him goodbye - he moved my face to kiss it! 

Holy heck you guys, I'm still *reeling*! I can't believe it. Writing this out makes it sound like ""duh he liked you"" but for real we were super close friends so sometimes the lines get blurred, and emotions are misread.

I just... he *held* my *face* in his *hands* and kissed me, so perfectly. We've been past the ""is-this-a-fling"" stage for so long that I think it might actually be happening this time! He opened the door for me to leave and before he shut it said ""I love you."" Of course I instantly said it back because it's all I've been able to think about since I last saw him. Then he said ""will I see you again soon?"" I said ""Yes. You'd better!"" That boy smiled and shut the door. Then he waved at me from his porch as I drove off.

Ugh he's so cute and I'm just.... I'm just so blessed. All the bull *crap* leading up to this day has been so intense, and I just don't even have the words to express how danged lucky I feel.

Thanks for letting me gush, Reddit. I feel like the luckiest human on the planet today! I hope you're all well, and I feel overflowing love for everyone and everything right now. Wow.

3 years after separation (filed for divorce but she refused to sign the papers, the judge threw out the divorce, now she has to re-file). She's since had a child with a deadbeat who's in prison now apparently. Have a beautiful son (with her), 8 years old in October.

Got an assault charge for getting into a fight at a skate park, put on probation (I did my time and have learned my lesson, had a lot of anger in my life after the separation, not making excuses but that's the only thing I can say that would mildly explain my actions).

Re-built my credit and finally have my own apartment where I can raise my son (after staying with family and most recently a motel for 6 months).

Got my teeth fixed!

I will be celebrating 5 years at my job next month (longest I've held a job at one company, have been employed since 15 though).

We have a few ideas in mind, but would also like to hear suggestions from the users. 

Here are some of the things we've thought of:

* Mirror Submissions. Any successful submissions in r/NeutralPolitics could either be crossposted, or ""mirrored"", in NeutralTalk. This way, the content and substance of the question is the same, but the differing rules for comments can offer two unique discussion paths to unfold.
* Regular stickied debate megathreads. Take a topic from real world events and use it as a platform to have an open weekly/bi-monthly/monthly debate.
* Broaden the topics. Open up what is allowed in NeutralTalk so it isn't neccessarily about politics. Things like ethics, philosophy, values and other questions and topics that would normally fall outside of NP/NT's goals as a purely political subreddit.

Let us know what you think of these ideas and please share any others you have.

Finally, if you're motivated to help us take on the project of reworking this subreddit, consider becoming a moderator and [message us.](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralTalk)

Also, please see my imposter syndrome post if you so choose. I want to be responsible and have those adult conversations but am scared of upsetting the person. I feel like I have to water down and be vague or fast and snippy about these conversations that are SUPER important. I am a radical centrist. I know this because this is always the place I end up, and the place I feel the safest. But especially because my fwb has seen me hop from one political identity to another while I was doing mental gymnastics for all the RIGHT reasons for some years and grew and evolved myself as a person which is a GOOD thing, I can’t help but to hate for myself for believing in common human decency things such as strict and serious and thorough, uncomfortable talks about consent.

And then I feel imposter syndrome about THAT because this has literally never happened to me, so why should I fear it. I tell myself [I] must be the one with the bad intent otherwise why am I fixating on this

I know these conversations are not meant to be skimped but if I don’t skimp them I judge myself. Hell I judge myself even skimping them, that’s my problem",0

First off, full disclosure, I'm a Right-leaning Libertarian. I am not a Trump fan, I personally hate him, but did agree with more of his policies than most Democratic candidates especially progressives like Bernie and AOC, etc. Up until 4-5 months ago, I was still considering Trump. (If you want to discuss my viewpoints let me know, but that's not the point of this post). With that said, the last 4 months have pushed me over the edge. I personally don't think his COVID response was as bad as everyone says it was but it definitely could have been better, I think he needed to take it more seriously earlier and listen to his advisors instead of mouthing off about drugs that don't work, his rhetoric and Tweets are downright evil, but what really pushed me over the edge was his calling for people of Michigan and other states protesting against there elected officials lockdowns, to ""rise up"" and fight their Governors. As someone who values state rights and small federal Government that was borderline treason and his recent handling or (lack thereof)the George Floyd killing and civil unrest. I've gotten to a point where I can't let his few political stances I agree with outweigh his terrible leadership skills, the unbelievable amount of damage he is doing to the USA on the international scale, and the amount the idiotic rhetoric he spouts on a daily basis. We so desperately need a leader right now with the two current crisis and he just isn't that one.

Now that said. If the election were today, I'd likely vote Libertarian. Before you tell me that's a wasted vote, It wouldn't be taking away from Biden and I live in a blue district in a state that always goes red (Northwest Indiana/Chicago Suburb in Indiana) I have a feeling Biden is going to pick a very progressive VP and I personally am concerned for Biden's mental health (Trump's as well to be fair). I would not be shocked if Biden does not last 4-8 years and it falls to a VP.


So TLDR: I think the only way I would consider voting for Biden is if he picks a moderate or even possibly a right-leaning Vice President. I could maybe get behind a Klobuchar, but what about someone like Mitt Romney, I feel like he would be able to appeal to the large and growing number of right-wingers who cannot stand Trump. Democrats and moderates are going to vote against Trump no matter what, I really don't think Biden should be pandering to the far left, instead he should do what he can to pull votes from the center/right-leaning people.

However, I do question why the rioting is still going on as it is my understanding that all the officers involved have now been convicted for their crime, so what are the riots looking to achieve now?

From my understanding of most protests there's usually a main short term goal, (ie. The stonewall riots of 69 which were rioting to change to legal rights of the gay community) and it doesn't seem like there is any immediate change that can be made as legally in western countries all races have the same rights. 

I understand that racism is still an issue that needs to be worked on, but I'm not sure what the continuation of these riots is meant to achieve. 

I apologise if anyone finds this offensive in anyway, that's not my intention. I'm merely looking to learn more about the situation.

However, in the month since then, the 18-44 age group has quickly increased in their compliance level, even passing above the 45-64 age group and almost to the level of those 65 and older. Although the 45-64 age group has grown more likely to comply, the likelihood of compliance from people in this age group is currently lower than both the older and the younger generation.

How can we explain this pattern in people's attitudes? It is easy to see why older people would be more likely to comply with a stay-at-home order, because they are more vulnerable to the disease.

https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralTalk/comments/gkwdq2/how_to_fix_all_world_issues/,neutraltalk,,1589671366,How to fix all world issues?,0,0.33," I have thought a lot about creating the ideal government, but there are so many broken systems so my approach to fix all is to fix issues one at a time. It may sound simple but I don't think it happens. Like any app most of the time it has bugs, can lack features or have a bad layout. With a lot of work you can fix those issue. The goal of an app is a bit like a government. It intends to achieve a set of tasks but usually doesn't. The government is meant to keep people safe, housed, fed and healthy. Though the government does not fully achieve this as there is still a lot of people who don't have those things. But with a lot of work all those issues can be fixed. Unfortunately the first issue is arguably the most difficult to fix. The people who are doing the issue fixing are an issue. Many of the issue fixers (or politicians) are incapable, unethical, dumb, rude, evil, selfish and other destructive things. So the first thing that needs to change is the way you check those qualities in a person and to stop picking people with bad qualities. Currently, the parliament system is not the solution to this, it does in no way filter out the problematic people. I would like to know if anyone can think of a way to filter out people with bad traits.

Also, I think the current definition of government is incorrect as it does’tn contain nature and scope. For example the definition of a business is “a person's regular occupation, profession, or trade”. The nature is a person and the scope is the profession. Compared to the definition of government “the group of people with the authority to conduct the policy, actions, and affairs of a state, organisation, or people”. The stated nature is to conduct policy and actions, I think conducting policies and affairs is what you do rather nature which is the basic or inherent features,  feature being to keep us safe and healthy. I believe my definition of government has both nature and scope “a government is a system of people who protect each other's health.” nature to protect each other and the scope is the people.

I am asking these questions in hopes of getting objective, factual  answers/information so that I can continue to find my bearings.

Lately I have seen a lot of news regarding gerrymandering, particularly in WI, and how it has or has not affected the elections and balance of power in the state legislature. I understand the basic concept of gerrymandering - that it is the manipulation or changing of political district boundaries in an effort to ensure re-election of particular incumbents or election of fellow party members of the incumbents - but all I see is talk about how corrupt and evil it is, which leads me to wonder how it's still a thing. Common sense would tell me it still exists because all political parties love gerrymandering... \*except\* for when it doesn't go in their favor. So my questions are this:

What are arguments/examples both for and against gerrymandering? Also, is it know how it became a thing in the first place?

Just  thinking about it logically I can understand how political district  boundaries might need to change based on how the population of a state or county may shift around. But then again, that's why we have the electoral college at the federal level - to ensure an equal voice for  those that live in a state with a lower population density than the  major coastal area. So why isn't a similar system used at the state level? Or is it and I'm just completely ignorant of it?

Again,  I am looking for factual replies, and any credible sources that can be  quoted/linked would be appreciated. I would also appreciate it if any  sources brought forward could not be from any of the MSM channels, I  don't really trust any of them, but that might be difficult so in the  end I'll take any information that I can.

A [Pew Research Study in Feb 2020](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/02/12/key-findings-about-americans-confidence-in-science-and-their-views-on-scientists-role-in-society/) showed that more Americans report confidence that scientists act in the public interest compared to (shown in descending order) public school principals, religious leaders, the news media, business leaders, and elected officials.

Further analysis shows a clear partisan divide in attitudes/perceptions toward scientists. Democrats are more inclined than Republicans to think scientists should have an active role in science policy matters. Indeed, most Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents (73%) hold this position, compared with 43% of Republicans and GOP leaders. Furthermore, 54% of Democrats say scientists’ policy decisions are usually better than those of other people, while two-thirds of Republicans (66%) say that scientists’ decisions are either no different from or worse than other people’s.

Furthermore, there is even a partisan split on the most fundamental tenet of science––whether the scientific method produces reliable results. Most Democrats with high levels of science knowledge (86%) say the scientific method generally produces accurate conclusions. By comparison, 52% of Democrats with low science knowledge say this. However, scientific knowledge has little bearing on Republicans’ beliefs about the scientific method––51% of Republicans with low science knowledge say the scientific method generally produces accurate conclusions, whereas 59% of Republicans with high science knowledge say this.

**Questions**

1. What is behind the partisan divide re: perceptions of the role of science in society?
2. What is behind the partisan divide re: perceptions of the reliability of the scientific method?
3. Why don't higher levels of scientific education have more of an impact on Republicans' perceptions re: the reliability of the scientific method?

The bill in question would be designed to positively affect the consumers, and with any luck the economy.

An example of excessive markup would be printer ink cartridges, or razorblades, which cost virtually nothing to produce, printer ink cartridges being 30 cents, but costing 40 cents per unit. It would theoretically put a stop to gouging consumers for something that costed them a small fraction of what they sell it for.

I'm not saying they should sell it to everyone wholesale, simply that there should be a reasonable limit imposed.

Potential structuring of said bill could include: A static limit for all products, say, 30% for example. I do not personally agree with this, as 30% can vary wildly between products.

Variable limits per product, taking into account the base production cost of the item, as well as the wealth of the company. With this, items that have larger production costs would be allowed a smaller limit, as larger numbers are more harshly influenced by percentage increases or decreases. Cheaper to produce items would have more leeway with how they can be priced, though not nearly as extreme as the examples listed above.

I can see potential issues with this system arising in the reduced income overall, though it may balance out naturally with higher sales.

A potential solution to this problem could be found in tax benefits, seeing as corporations already pay a large margin of the nation's taxes, it's potentially viable to give slight tax benefits to compensate for large chunks of lost revenue, within reason. The government is massively overspending as is, with massive amounts of money simply unaccounted for when missing, this could potentially help pull back some of the overspending.

I firmly believe a bill like this could potentially benefit consumers, companies, and the economy as a whole, but I'd like to hear people's thoughts on how said theoretical bill could be improved or expanded upon.",0

I know there are plenty of people who say ""it's his money, he get's to spend it however way he chooses"", and I can agree with that.

But, when you have more money than some _countries_, I just don't see that reasoning holding up in an """"""ethical"""""" sense (can't come up with a better word)...

I'd like to think that money is power, and with great power comes great responsibility. If you have that much money to spend, and there's poverty and hunger and environmental catastrophe and social prejudice and all of these problems, you can choose to help or not. But, if you don't, you'll have to accept that some of that is on you, wether you've directly contributed to it or not.

_(and also if you're Jeff Besos your wealth does come partially from poor working conditions, violations of civilian privacy, and monopolizing entire industries through your company)._

Then again, I have money. Don't have a lot of it as a college student, but I have money. I can make an impact, however small. If I don't, that should mean I'm responsible as well for all these problems by this reasoning.

I'm trying to understand what the other side is thinking, but my position is so diametrically opposed that I just... can't even put myself in the mindset.

Like I can look at the Hong Kong crisis and think, ""Yeah, the PRC is attempting to assert its authority to maintain control over an economically valuable region, send a message about its authority to other regions with separatist movements, maintain law and order as it sees it, etc.,"" but I can't do that for the Israeli right.

This is a problem, obviously, because it means I can't give them a fair and balanced treatment - even if I personally believe that's giving the Israeli government far more than a fair shake - and thus can't do things like write about them or even really understand them.

I'm not asking to have my view changed - hence why I'm not in CMV - so much as I just want the mindset and rationale explained to me enough that I can get into it to speak fairly about it.

Currently, health insurance companies have to refund premiums that don't go for services if over 80% and deductible is met, but there are other examples of national universal health care where private insurance companies perform their market service and are kept to much lower profit margins; Germany for example caps their for-profit insurance companies to 4.5% profit not the 20% American health insurance is capped at. So why doesn't Buttigieg, O'Rourke, Harris, or any other candidate that is loyal to having continuation of private insurance companies in the mix simply put out a proposal where the insurance is capped at 3%-4% profits (what are saying that the greatest nation in the planet can't do anything better than the krouts? USA USA USA /s ). That would provide a significant policy difference from the staid Biden who would never introduce anything more than Obamacare with the public option and Medicare-For-All. Why isn't this pushed by the candidates who desperately need to make themselves distinct from the crowded field that would provide retorts to M4A 
  
Potentional debate response: You're right Bernie countries all over have figured it, that's why I'm proposing how Germany, Israel, and Japan have delivered universal health care through private insurance and cut their costs to half what we pay without raising taxes on the middle class (or at least no where near as much I don't have specific numbers but seems likely to be less than M4A) like your plan
 
Doesn't this seem intuitive and logical to pursue rather than being lost in the crowd of medicare buy-in/public option? It wouldn't be popular with the insurance companies for sure, but the voters aren't that concerned about the insurance companies little feelings, in fact voters in the Democratic primaries would likely to be in favor of taking insurance companies down a couple of pegs.

She's coming to the US on a fiance visa soon and I can't wait to marry her. I'd like to talk with her about hot button racial issues when they come up in the news or political debates, but I have no direct experience with the issues and the coverage I've seen doesn't really explain the issues very well.

For instance, someone I'm talking to recently posted this article,[https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2014/06/the-case-for-reparations/361631/)

The article says a lot without really justifying it's connections. The horrifying injustices against the Ross family are well documented and there may be grounds for a lawsuit. But it doesn't explain how that story connects to the modern era. I'm sure there are many similar stories, but the article jumps from the racism in the 1960s to crime statistics in the 2010s. What happened during those 50 years? How does poverty lead to a homicide rate that's triple the rest of Chicago, which already has a high homicide rate? My family is white, but we were barely above the poverty line. I have seven siblings and I think the worst trouble one of us got in was my sister got caught shoplifting once. We weren't involved in gangs, violence or anything close to murder. Poverty doesn't force people into crime. Then why is it so bad in North Lawndale?

It accuses Mayor Nutter of racism when he said ""Too many men making too many babies they don’t want to take care of, and then we end up dealing with your children."" How is that criticism racist? Is anyone suggesting it's not a problem when people have babies when they don't want to or can't take of them? Are we just supposed to ignore that issue? Again, poverty doesn't force people to have unprotected sex. National statistics show over 60% of black kids are growing up in single parent homes, significantly more than other racial groups. What is causing that disparity?

Current list of representatives is taken from here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Representatives_from_New_York

Active voter numbers were gathered from here (april 2016 numbers): http://rochester.nydatabases.com/database/registered-voters-by-party

NY has 27 seats in the House of Representatives. The current seat break up is R=6, D=21 (R=22.22%, D=77.77%). This is an almost 1 to 4 split (for every 1 republican, we have 4 democrats).

According to the site with voter numbers, there were 10.7 million registered active voters (out of 19.5 million residents estimated in 2018, NYC is estimated at 8.4 million residents). I know the numbers are from different years, but bear with me. I am sure the numbers don't change rapidly. That means that NYC has about 40% of the state's populations. This also means that just under 55% of NY is registered to vote (only citizens are allowed to register to vote in NY).

Based on the numbers so far, we should expect to have about 8 million registered active voters enrolled in the Democratic party and around 2 million active registered republican voters.

Here's what we actually see (counts in millions, percentage of active registered voters):
Dem - 5.25 (49%)
Rep - 2.55 (23.8%)
Con - 0.15 (1.5%)
Gre - 0.02 (0.2%)
Wor - 0.04 (0.4%)
Ind - 0.43 (4%)
Blank - 2.25 (21%)

I didn't bother listing some parties with less than 10k registered active voters.

There are as many Republican registered active voters as there are Independant and Blank selection. Based on above numbers, it seems that Republican voters are properly represented by a proportional number of Republican representatives. Then you look at the Democratic representatives in relation to other active voters. Which brings us to two interesting questions:
1. What if the blanks were to vote for some third party? This would mean that Democrats would have 13 seats, Republicans 6 seat and other parties would split the other 8 seats.
1. What would happen to the active voter distribution if the people knew that a third/fourth party was a viable choice to get at least 1 seat. Get 1 seat from the 5-10 most populous states (which get the most seats in the house) and you now have a small faction of a 3rd party on a national stage, allowing them to further spread their platform and gain voters.

PS:

In the 2016 presidential election (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election#Results_by_state

), NY voted as follows (in million votes):
Dem - 4.55
Rep - 2.82
Lib - 0.18
Gre - 0.11

So for anyone who has no clue about these treaties here a quick summary:

INF treaty

>The **treaty** prohibits both parties from possessing, producing or flight-testing ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges of 500-5,500km. ... Existing weapons had to be destroyed, and a protocol for mutual inspection was agreed upon.

New START treaty

>The [New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (New START)](https://www.armscontrol.org/treaties/new-strategic-arms-reduction-treaty) continues the bipartisan process of verifiably reducing U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear arsenals

There are many reason for terminating the INF treaty or expanding it to other countries since the INF treaty is a Cold War relic where we had a bilateral word order compared to our todays multilateral world order, where countries like China, India, Pakistan can develop INF without facing repercussions, while Russia and the US aren't allowed.

Another reason why the US will leave the INF treaty is because Russia didn't abide with the rules and started developing INF with a range between 480km -2500km.

After the treaty is terminated the US will probably start stationing INF in Europe (even if many European countries are against it) and in Western allied forces like Japan or Taiwan or maybe Hongkong.

So are we heading for another Cold War ?

I've been in a long-standing debate regarding the 2nd amendment and gun control with a friend. I can hold my own pretty well, and I am of the belief that there should be certain restrictions on what guns are available to civilians. 

However, someone not in the normal debate group mentioned something that's really thrown me for a loop. They brought up shall not be infringed. The direct definition of infringe is to encroach upon, or act as to limit or undermine something. Specifically, I'm looking at the definition being 'as to limit'. 

By this definition however, it's clearly stated that the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed upon - meaning no limitations should be set. But this means purchasing things like Rocket Launchers, or miniguns should also be legal, and I think that's absolutely absurd. But, by the word of the law, limiting any civilian of the US from purchasing these items, or owning or operating these items, would be breach of this second amendment.

We have become aware that this is wrong. Hating people based on protected classes is wrong. 

Whether pedophilia is a mental illness or an orientation it is hypocritical to exclude it from the fight against prejudice. 

If it is a mental illness it would be like depression, or schizophrenia. Both have had campaigns to destigmatize and promote acceptance. This had lead to better help and a better outcomes. 

If it is an orientation, well then any argument you could use was most likely historically used against other orientations. The common response is consent, except sex with anyone who doesn't or can't consent is something anyone can do. A child abuser is the same as an adult rapist, they both dont care about consent. This is not an argument that I will engage with.

It is one of these two. There is no third category it falls under. Both are under the umbrella of things people have fought to get destigmatized.

I personally like Sanders however, I believe people are overestimating him believing that should he win his tenure as president would be among one of the greatest in U.S. history. 

Why I believe that he is being overestimated is purely because of how he has a large and loud following online. In the 2018 midterms many progressive democrats did not win their primary and many progressives that ran for a major political office (senator or governor) did not get very far (Florida was an exception, however I always found it odd how a state that is consistently harmed due to climate change still elects people that flat out deny it, but I digress). From the 2018 midterms we can see that red states are becoming more conservative and many fans of Sanders seem to believe that the only way to combat this is to be more progressive. At times they seem just as stubborn as hardcore Trump supporters. While I do believe there were some shady things that happened in the 2016 primaries, it probably wasn't enough to make Sanders lose. Clinton won the popular vote in the primaries as well but because Sanders lost his base acted like sore losers.

If Sanders wins the 2020 election it seems that many are expecting him to stay 110% with his policies. To me this seems to be an issue, Trump has done the same and he lost the house and 7 governorships in the midterms. I believe if Sanders were to stick with his policies, another tea party movement will likley happen.

>We do not yet have Robert Mueller’s report and Attorney General William Barr is a shady character. He was a key player in covering up the Iran-Contra scandal and getting pardons for some of the key criminals involved with it. But, it would be an unthinkably brazen move—even within Trump world—for William Barr to just whole cloth misquote Robert Mueller when he says that Mueller determined that there was no collusion, no criminal activity by Trump and Russia to interfere in the 2016 elections.

Scalhill later continues:

>This much is clear: This has been an utterly colossal media failure and it reveals how little things have actually changed with the broader press since the Iraq War lies. The overall tone of much of the reporting on this Trump-Russia story has started from the position that the intelligence community was being truthful about Trump and Russia. The reporting then sought to further confirm those assertions. It was confirmation bias to the nth degree.

...and...

>We have been subjected to more than two years of nonstop, fact-free assertions and wild theories masquerading as fact, masquerading as insightful analysis. We have been repeatedly told that it was the beginning of the end for Trump. And there were tens upon tens of millions of dollars spent on this spectacle. Thousands upon thousands upon thousands of hours of Congressional time and energy was poured into proving the conspiracy theory that Trump is a secret Bolshevik operative being run by Putin.

...

>If the Mueller report says what William Barr says it does regarding no collusion with Russia, it will amount to a massive gift for Donald Trump. It might actually help Trump win again in 2020.

It is the result of innumerable social media posts from liberal/progressive individuals implying I am ethically bound to vote for whoever the Democratic party's presidential candidate winds up being. This seems an affront to the notions of liberty and democracy, but at the same time, the only rational ethical choice. I am not here to argue about political specifics, but merely the underlying philosophy and ethics of one's decision while voting. Also note that I have never studied political science or ethics, so if this is a well-worn debate, I'd love to know about it.

To start off, I'm going to define my terms. Others may disagree with these definitions, but this is what _I_ mean when I use these terms:

*Liberty* - The freedom to do whatever you want, including the freedom to act in self-interest. One's Liberty does not entitle them to cause harm to others (My liberty to swing my arms ends at your nose).

*Ethics* - The philosophical guidelines of right and wrong, and the study thereof.

*Modern Pluralistic Republic* - Essentially the state of the United States in 2019. A large diversity of people with different life experiences, goals, and cultures being governed by a representative republic. Access to political office generally only occurs through political machines.

*Given That:*

* One of the United States' founding principals is to maximize the Liberty of its citizens (""Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness"").
* Each individual has the liberty to vote for any candidate they see fit.
* An elected official can potentially cause unspecified harm to unspecified people after their election.
* A republican form of democracy, by design, dilutes the impact of an individual's vote through grouping (e.g. districts, the Electoral College, etc).

Does one actually have the right to vote for anyone they want?

If a candidate campaigns in part on encroaching on the liberty of some people, and I vote for that candidate, am I violating my ethical obligations not to cause harm to others despite my vote being ""washed"" in the electoral process?

If I vote for a third-party candidate with a very ethically sound platform, but that third-party candidate splits the vote enough to allow a candidate who might limit the liberty of others to be elected, have I committed an ethical violation?

If a third-party candidate has (in my estimation) a morally superior platform to any other candidate, is it ethical to vote for that candidate, knowing full well that it limits the chances of the ""less-bad"" candidate beating the ""worse"" candidate?

At what point am I free of ethical responsibilities? How much ""harm"" does an individual have to suffer as a direct or indirect result of my vote before I am responsible for it? Obviously bodily harm, but what about psychological trauma? What about light depression?

Is making moral decisions based entirely on ""maybe"" and ""if"" lighten the ethical burden?

Where does the liberty of an individual voter end and the ethical responsibility to cause no harm to others begin?",0

Their videos on YT came off as an impulsive rage rather than a critical explanation as to why it offended them. One recurring point was that it was ""anti-men"". I, personally, didn't see as an attack on men. Yes it wasn't catering to men like their other ads but it wasn't definitely attacking them viciously.

I'd like to add that I'm not a US resident. Things there are different from where I live. So if a come off as ignorant, I apologise. One can read all the news articles and watch many videos but noone can be fully knowledgeable until they experience it first hand.

So I would really appreciate a critical explanation as to why the ad is offensive and if people are rightfully offended.

The main question I want to ask is what sort of news sources do you guys find the best and most reliable? I'm a mid-20s white male who leans notably progressive. I grew up in a conservative household without having much of a grasp on what politics meant, and since having come into my own have ended up moving a good deal left of my family and most people around me. I enjoy The Young Turks and follow and agree with most of Bernie Sanders' positions as an example. But the more involved and interested I get in politics, the more aware I am that I'm in an echo chamber. I see a lot of media that supports what I already believe and not much from opposing viewpoints that don't seem, to me, rather radical. Especially in today's climate where everything is more hyper-politicized and it's so easy to find only people that only agree with you and cut the rest out as ""fake news"" so to speak.

I fully admit that I have a lot to learn and I think that neither side is the absolute paradigm of what a party should be. I'm mostly really curious and eager to try and break away from my bubble. Not necessarily to change my viewpoints, but at least to see what the other side of the aisle sees. I'm also happy to have a discussion with anybody regarding policy positions and I feel like this would be a good place to at least start making a more nuanced opinion of the world at large.

Krugman is not a technologist but it’s not hard to imagine how he would react if he was asked: what about technology? The reason for societies is the division of labour which, in turn, is the building block of the economy. Economy, indeed, is the most fundamental layer of any society. It is said that the market addresses the most basic human needs. And things like morality belong to higher levels. Bullshit. At least that is what I will try to argue: Morality is far more fundamental than that. Morality doesn’t address human basic needs you might say. Again bullshit (I would use stronger words if the article wasn’t about morality).  
 How can we change the values of society? What does it have to do with economic value? Sharing economy, for instance, changes the notion of value in the economy. It’s not that people won’t spend but they will buy services that enable them to share stuff instead of producing them. What is the role of tools we build? Technology enables us to have such a weird economy which potentially can address many of our environmental concerns. Then what is the role of technology in morality? Technology helps us to redefine value, moral value. And finally how will it affect the structure of firms, from small firms to states? ”

Those who possibly found the first letter disturbing. Those who thought to themselves, outright, it was wrong.  
 Before posting my first letter I paused for a while, I was about to create an image of myself which would last forever. Then I thought I wasn’t creating anything. That’s who I am. Normally it’s not good that exposing who you really are, damages you, but that’s how things are.  
 The aim of my articles was to encourage debates on topics relevant to the whole world. But I understand that the real me is on the way. So I decided to write this letter.  
 In such an interconnected, complex world we live in, no individual, no single idea can save the world. Put aside, individuals. Ideas should be discussed, rejected, developed and transformed. Ideas which have been developed collectively will lead to lasting social reforms. Ignore individuals. Ignore their mistakes, their misjudgments. Let the debate begin.  
 For a long time prison for me was something to be forgotten. It took years to realize the opposite was true. The lesson was in fact far too valuable to be forgotten. Some months ago I noticed that Mr Gauke, UK Secretary for Justice had expressed his intentions for prison reform. As a person who had experienced life on both sides of prison doors, I thought it was time to bring the topic to the foreground. Mr Gauke had mentioned reforming one side of the prison doors. There are, in fact, two sides to each door and both sides of prison doors need reform. And it’s not limited to the UK. Global problems need global solutions.   
 For me, civil disobedience wasn’t an easy choice. I wouldn’t do that if I hadn’t clearly and firmly rejected violent solutions and protests in my previous articles. Then protests in France began. It wasn’t entirely peaceful and it achieved as much as protests in this kind could achieve: A few laws were overturned. And it urged me to write this letter to make it clear that no profound reform is ever achieved by violence. No violent solution exists for global problems our world faces. We need no more destruction. Destruction, of the environment and global stability among other things, are being done on a daily basis. Construction, however, based on global collaboration is the solution.

And lastly, I should apologize to those who found my first letter disturbing. I posted that for what I believed to be a good cause, globally.

Everyone talks about this as though the enemies are the government. That's who we say they're rebelling against.

What if it's the news itself? We're rebelling against the private sector, not the public sector. Everyone that voted for Trump as an 'f u' vote, for instance, wanted to stick it to the people that write these absurd headlines, demean entire classes of people (which they may well be a part of), and so on. And then, you might see it as an 'us vs them' rebellion or a polarization. That's the other news story.

But is that really true? Or is that the press controlling the narrative, directing everyone away from themselves?

Not that the press is the only aspect of the private sector that people wanted to rebel against. Surely, the issue with jobs is due in part to how US corporations have decided to conduct business. You can say it's just them pursuing all ends while staying within the law, but that would be your American bias talking -- we are more litigious than anyone. Other people believe (and sometimes prove) that different types of business practices can be both more benevolent and more profitable. In a round about way, the voters want to rebel against the big wigs at those major corporations, not the doofus in office that couldn't possibly write enough laws to slow them down.

Are psychadelics, social media, and social programs a better solution than further restricting gun ownership?",16,0.76,"We absolutely have to start doing \*something\* about this problem. If we're going to be the only country with liberal gun ownership rights, we need to start being much more active in solving our people's problems so these things stop happening. 

How? My thoughts:

(1) Much more pervasive tracking of mental health issues, not for immediate enforcement/denial purposes, but for outreach purposes.

http://www.digitaljournal.com/life/health/ai-to-search-social-media-to-predict-suicides/article/511220

(2) Accelerate testing of Psychadelics to treat PTSD and depression. 

https://www.webmd.com/mental-health/news/20180918/psychedlic-drugs-to-treat-depression-ptsd

(3) Expand social nets and improve distribution of wealth across the board. The 'every man for himself' model is easy to understand, but it is not the most efficient means to vibrant, strong communities and nations. Every country with laws governing businesses is 'socialistic' to varying degrees. 

We need to decide whether 'our fellow Americans' are people we care about, or not. If not, the mass shootings will not only continue, but grow. 

There are other steps which can be taken, but most of them will infringe on gun possession, concealed carry, open carry and other '2nd Amendment' issues that will be fought tooth and nail by the NRA.

So, if we 'cannot do anything about' guns in America, then we need to start doing something 'about Americans' to protect and look after their mental health. We need to do more for our veterans, our poor, and people who are suffering from life challenges. 

Countries like Switzerland, which has the next highest rate of gun ownership, has 50% as many guns per capita, and the US has 500% more homicides by gun per capita. Switzerland does not have the 'social gun culture' America has. Guns and violence are not 'sexualized' there, as they are here, and the country also has a much more socially oriented system for the care of it's people (healthcare, taxation, social programs, etc). Despite this 'socialization', the Swiss are, per capita, TWICE as well off as Americans.

http://www.nationmaster.com/country-info/compare/Switzerland/United-States

On that basis, we either need to get rid of guns in America (I'm not a fan of that idea), or create a much better care structure for Americans, improving social safety nets, and we must stop bankrupting our populace with absurd business/insurance-centric healthcare costs. There is zero indication that this would harm GDP, employment rates, medical innovation and treatment, or the overall economy. Much the opposite. The current environment of 'everyone is on their own, here's your gun, protect the unborn, to hell with everyone after that' is not working, and failure to take meaningful steps to improve the situation will result in more of the same...",0

To those not familiar with it, it was similar to the last US presidential election in the sense that most people were dissatisfied with the candidates they had to choose from, the two candidates that made it to the final round had extremely high rejection rates, but still the race came down to a puppet of the corrupt former ruling party running a populist campaign centered entirely around the poorer states, and a bigot demagogue with fascist inclinations running a campaign entirely focused on slandering the previous government and making vague promises to fix everything.  

While there were many contributing factors that lead to such a situation, including easy targets like a perceived lack of political education and the use of manipulative propaganda and ""fake news"", I believe the crux of the problem is an universal flaw of large democracies: Appealing to obstinate minorities is more valuable than appeasing a freethinking majority.  

Earlier in this text I mentioned a similarity between the political situation in the US and the political situation in Brazil, now I need to mention some key differences. The two main ones is that Brazil has a multi-party political system and that voting is compulsory. I am favorable to both of those even if they have their flaws, mainly because they should discourage polarization and voter apathy, but they have shown themselves to be insufficient. 
 
Simply put, both of the candidates that made it to the final round had plenty of things about them that pissed off almost all of the open-minded voters, but they also secured themselves a significant number of closed-minded voters to the point where it became extremely unlikely any other candidate could make it to the final round, since they would need to rely on being a consensus reached by a large majority of open-minded voters, which naturally wouldn't happen since open-minded voters are different and will vote for different people based on their different opinions on many different political matters.  

So then the two most hated candidates made it to the final round and the hard choice of the lesser evil was forced upon the open-minded voters and at that point the elections were no longer about realpolitik or even ideologies, they were about a very polarized competition and personal moral dilemmas people had to solve to be able to live with their choice. Such a depressing experience only leads to even more voter apathy.  

This is a trend I think will only grow around the world in the information era, and solutions need to be found if democracy is to sustain itself. Going back to the title of this thread, I wonder if this is something that could work, perphaps if the first round of Brazilian elections were about eliminating the most unnaceptable candidates instead of narrowing it down to the initially most supported ones, perphaps mechanisms like populism and extremism would stop being such powerful tools.  

tl;dr
polarization is bad for democracy, early rounds of votes should be used to make the extremes eliminate each other so closed-minded voters are the ones who are forced to compromise or abstain in the final round.",0

The world is rife w/ the debate over ""civility"" and ""neutrality"" and ""both-sides-ism"". The debate is profoundly unproductive, and I think it can be attributed to the lack of slowing down and considering why they are values to start with.  


**Civility**  
\- If there is no social contract where civility is enforced, then, through intimidation or outright violence, the dominant narratives can be set by *those willing and able to intimidate/be violent* (read: ""*not* those who are most correct""). It's a patch against a race to the bottom.  


**Neutrality**  
\- The world consists of people across the spectrum in terms of ""influence"". If we hold people to the standard of ""taking an objective viewpoint"", we prevent the dominant narratives from being set by/on behalf of *those with the power to influence* (read: ""*not* those who are most correct""). It's a patch against self-reinforcing loops.  


**Both-Sides-ism**  
\- To effectively instill in someone else the desire to act according to your agenda, it's advantageous to not litigate the ""cons"" column of your position. Without considering ""both sides"", we let the dominant narratives be set by/on behalf of *those who got to the podium first* (read: ""*not* those who are most correct""). It's a patch against incentivizing speed over truth.  


**THE PROBLEM:**  
\- Like the ""fallacy fallacy"", each of *these* can be wielded as grounds for dismissal of very real perspectives.  


**Civility:**  
\- Especially in situations with grossly disparate positions of power, ""civil discussion"" can fail to be productive. One ""side"" might be literally begging for their life, and the other might be going through motions of what they think ""civil debate"" looks like (while simultaneously falling into traps like ""the backfire effect"", ""dunning kruger effect"", or a million other very real sources of unresolved cognitive dissonance).  
\- Within civil debate, *it's really easy* to walk away not changing your mind (regardless of presence of ""hard evidence against you"") if that's what you're committed to. we're just not as smart/consistent as we think we are.  
\- Imagine, as a feudal peasant, arguing against a feudal lord (who is committed to civility!) that the system in place is unfair. if you think you'd be successful, you're probably overestimating your ""debate ability"".  
\- So, one strategy is to shirk civility:  
\- ""no, we *won't* calmly share perspectives and then go have a beer- *my child is subject to deportation, you just form opinions from the comfort of your armchair""*.  
\- So you raise the stakes:  
\- ""I'm going to yell and draw attention to myself and embarrass you so you have a *self-interested reason* to actually adhere to the reality of my argument"".  
\- \^ effective! (but totally degenerate if applied to every argument)  
\- ""*I will physically hurt you unless you change""*.  
\- \^ completely escalated to out-of-hand proportions... unless you're literally held as a captive slave? or ...  
\- the question then is ""but who gets to set the appropriate line of incivility?""- now we're letting the dominant narrative be set by *those confident enough in their righteousness to lower the bar*; the very situation civility was in place to minimize.  


**tl;dr:** there are justified escalations of incivility, but it's hard (and important) to bound. unsolved problem! but ""always be totally polite no matter what or else you're wrong"" is *not* appropriate, and sides with those in power.  


**Neutrality:**  
\- Draws on a lot of the same themes as civility. Primary problem is ""people's assessment of their own ability to be 'neutral' greatly outperforms their actual ability"".  
\- (evidence: political positions are largely defined as answers to the question ""how things ought be"" \[not just ""for me"", but ""in general""\]. ""how things ought be- in general"" *by definition* doesn't change as you move around. however there exist *incredibly strong* correlations between political position and place of birth/residence. <- absolutely nonsense if any real proportion of the population was in fact ""neutral"").  
\- You only have to convince *yourself* that you're being neutral to cite it as strength in your argument. ""Look- I'm just trying to be neutral: if I came from an impoverished community I'd pull myself up by my bootstraps"".  
**tl;dr:** nobody at all ever is particularly good at ""being objective"", but it's the only perspective from which to realistically ""set"" global norms. unsolved problem! (er, I guess ""science"" has some pretty good rules to adhere to? but that takes years of familiarity w/ the nuance of those rules \[skill interpreting data, understanding of statistics, etc...\]. uh oh- getting off topic!)  


**Both-Sides-Ism:**  
\- Draws from both previous. A particularly pernicious effect of this is conflating ""keeping the discussion neutral/civil/playing out how 'serious discussions' should go"" with ""if there's at least 1 'pro' and 1 'con' to each 'side', then we should dedicate equal attention/time to both sides"" with ""every political perspective is identically good and bad"".  
\- it sets a standard that ""no perspective is *really* true/important/worth yelling about unless there is *no single angle from which* the opposing side can be justified"". It facilitates latching on to any small bit of information justifying your position, and feeling good for doing so because ""you're *actually* just being really considerate of all sides"", even when the ""big picture"" *clearly* paints you in the wrong.  


**tl;dr:** you can use ""both sides"" to feel good about yourself while ""equating any president with literally any other president"" for example. but the opposite is obviously ""seeks out perspective-reinforcing information"" and ""living in a bubble"". it's the difference between ""being stuck on your side"" vs. ""being stuck in the center"" (and if one side *really is* ""more correct"", the latter is worse). unsolved problem!  


Bonus- Fillibuster:   
\- ""Wanting to act according to an image of 'what civil debate looks like'"" quickly turns into ""Listen to my 50 part argument look at me I'm being very civil right now AKA I'll outlast you"". (See the length of this post...). but also complex ideas require complex (long) exposition. unsolved problem!  


**BIG TL;DR:**  
\- Good faith, productive discussion is really really hard (requires a ton of self discipline, experience, and skill). Everyone thinks they are good at it.""Civility"", ""Neutrality"", and ""Both-sides-ism"" can be as effectively wielded as ""constraints in keeping discussion productive"" as they can be ""self-preservation mechanisms"".  
\- Pointing to ""use them more!"" is destructive to effective (necessary, righteous) change.  
\- Pointing to ""use them less"" can empower our worst short-term tendencies.  


\- But right now, there's a president who has committed $1/2B tax fraud, whose lawyer has under oath testified to committing campaign fraud at his direction, and who indisputably regularly unrepentantly blatantly lies without any real contest, and the country is split on whether or not he's ""good"". Strict civility is getting us nowhere.

Why you should choose a side or a specific ideology for running a country? I think this just enhances the creation of a mayority, a minority, limits and sometimes confusion. Choosing decisions that will affect in the entire lives of millions of people is not something you can do based of the ideas of some other person because you think it is right. 

I think decisions should be made based of pure thinking, choosing the best and only the best case, and then, those decisions will collapse and could be classified as progressist or conservative, pure pragmatism and skepticism. 

But, isn’t having the idea of not following a line in politics, a line in its own? Yes, and so is the act of following a line. You can have the idea of following, and then follow, or you can have the idea of not following. 

Does politics lacks of philosophy? Or I’m just stuck in a weird and wrong idea and I didn’t realized yet?

Does anyone, perhaps Missouri locals, have any idea what her specific stance is (does she believe it should be illegal, would she allow for medical and rape exceptions, does she just not care for it but think that it should be up to the woman as in pro choice)? Additionally, what motivates someone to identify as pro-life in this scenario and is there a way to specifically define what pro-life even means?

Despite what some of my fellow compatriots and my Portoguese teacher at university , Jair Bolsonaro is not a fascist , what I am talking is that he doesn't have the mannerism, the ideology or perspective of the likes of Francisco Franco,Salazar, Antonio Primo de Rivera or the most famous bald politician of Italy, Mussolini. He is certainly authoritarian, I will not deny that. Also he is not a racist, he wouldn't even reach 1% if he was , in a country where race-mixing is the norm and when I went to vote, most of Bolsonaro voters I met were POC and most non-Bolsonaro voters were Caucasian.

Few people know that almost if not all left wing, left leaning, centrist parties are under investigation for corruption, one of the reasons why we kicked out with an impeachment the first woman president of the country is that she and her party drenched dry the country's fund to enrich themselves, and not because she was a woman.

Lula's imprisonment is the first of its kind in Brazil, AFAIK, no Brazilian president has been sent to jail since the restoration of democracy. He certainly not the only one to deserve it, but Moro had decided to make an example of him , because he had been in over a decade (the Mensalao scandal is the most famous example before Operation Car Wash). He stole billions from the Brazilian people, all under the guise of being a former metallurgy worker and the (previous) guillability of my fellow Brazilians. With him, crime went up and criminals nowadays have more rights than their victims, not to say that our prison system is a bloody joke, one prison was caught ON TAPE ON NATIONAL TELEVISION that allowed prisoners to come and go as THEY pleased. Brazilians feel so under threat so much that VIGILANTE JUSTICE is the norm in many parts of Brazil, one suche example was when a underage kid robbed a CHURCH (yes, many criminals are still minors and don't even respect places of worship) took a bible and wiped his ass with it! What happened next was they actually caught him, make him apologize in front of a camera, then they beat it him with bamboo-like canes until his head cracked opened up with blood. One big scandal about women security was when a pregnant favela girl was raped by other three minors of the favela (yes, they were all underage) after they killed her boyfriend and threw his body in a river! And they were all taken under the protection of Gleisi Hoffman, the woman who accused Jair Bolsonaro of ""rape apology""! What kind of a joke is this ? The only country that has a worse problem of injustice is South Africa and West Papua.

Jair Bolsonaro is one of the only few politicians that is not under investigation, which is a HUGE APPEAL to the Brazilian people, he wants to make the country safer, another ENOURMOUS APPEAL he wants a law that mandates rapists chemically castrated and give back the guns that were taken away with the DESARMAMENTO program of Lula, and make the economy return to its pre-2014 levels.

I would have voted either for a monarchist or liberal party, but in the first case there is no such thing (yet!) despite that we have probably a very huge monarchist movement (not enough to restore it but it's remarkable), the second case is that many Liberals except Jorge Amoedo (and its party) were already in power in Ninenties and in collusion with Lula's Worker's Party afterwards.

So please, stop calling Brazilians fascists,racists or other baseless accusations. We are none of those things, we just want a safer, much less corrupt country. That is why a lot of us voted and will vote for Bolsonaro.",0

For the record, I am not American and have no direct stake in US politics, nor am I purely asking about US politics - conservatism and liberalism in politics exist in most Western countries.

Obviously, this is not an easy question to ask, as many people on the left will naturally answer that conservativism is highly associated with bigotry and people on the right will claim there is no association between the two, but I'm trying to avoid making value judgements. This disagreement seems to occur mainly because people will have very different views about what constitutes bigotry depending on where on the political spectrum they lie.

For now, let's assume bigotry is a thing that exists and specifically define it (for the purposes of this discussion) as intolerance, prejudice hate towards women or minority groups or beliefs that those groups are inferior (I am aware other forms of bigotry exist, including that towards those of opposing political views which is shared by both the right and the left, but I am specifically asking about this form). Let's also assume there is some overlap between conservatism and bigotry that may or may not be a causation. To what extent can conservatism be divorced from bigotry, and - importantly - to what extent would people on both sides of the political spectrum agree that that worldview is both conservative and not bigoted? (Since this is highly subjective this is probably the best metric I have short of favouring one side or the other).

I'm not trying to start a fight here or make accusations, I'm just trying to get a better handle on how much my preconceptions need to be adjusted. I promise I am asking in good faith - even if I don't always show good faith or can be partisan when I discuss politics elsewhere, I am attempting to be neutral and not cling on to my biases in asking this question.

I guess in part what I'm looking for is examples of conservatives who don't express the misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic, etc. views associated with certain... more reported-on, divisive conservative politicians who've been in the news.",0

Pride, as opposed to shame and social stigma, is the predominant outlook that bolsters most LGBT rights movements throughout the world. Pride has lent its name to LGBT-themed organizations, institutes, foundations, book titles, periodicals and even a cable TV station and the Pride Library. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gay_pride)

Well M.A.P.'s (minor attracted person) otherwise called pedophile want very much the same. The right to be seen with just as much dignity and respect as anyone else, without being hated, feared, beaten, or stigmatized for an attraction we never chose. 

Let's be clear though a M.A.P. is someone who has not offended. The second you do you are a child abuser. Pedophiles on the whole do not want child sexual abuse to be acceptable. 

We care about children, probably a bit more so than the average person. Most want the best and sex is harmful when one side can't comprehend it.

See the thing is Pride Month seems to be more about the social acceptance of those with gender identities or sexualities that differ from heterosexuality, more broadly, the attraction between an adult man and an adult woman. In other words, seeing those that differ from the sexuality/gender norm or stereotype as being just as human and worthy of dignity and respect as anyone else.

So why don't we deserve that? Yes we can't act but that doesn't matter, a homosexual who is not having sex doesn't suddenly become straight after all.

 In these caskets we purposefully try to protect our bodies from the elements to try and preserve all our bones in one spot. We try to keep termites out, keep our worldly possessions close by, keep the family close together for eternity (creepy), or whatever other reason, for what? To help the family cope, because it was that individuals wish, or for religious reasons (which I guess is understandable, I dont agree but people can practice their religious rules).

We take all this energy and resources from earth which some of it is still with us when we go to the grave. We lock up those resources that could be given back to the ground from which we took it. Out of the millions of graves, imagine that resource given back. How many forests could thrive ,animals being able to find shelter and food in those forest, ect.

I feel that eventually standard graves aren't going to be an option. It could be because, we run out of space or the planet can't thrive because we keep taking and not giving back (highly unlikely due to graves but thought I'd throw it in). At what point will we go to where we wont use graves? When we run out space in this planet, what's next? ""Breaking News: First casket shot into space due to lack of graveyard space."". 

The world's population is growing and we only have so much land. People have to live somewhere. Some parts of the globe already seem over crowded.

Instead teach them about the world, and that chances are, no matter how hard you try, you won’t achieve your goals. That way if they do they’ll be happy, if they don’t then they’ll be bummed but at least they won’t feel completely lied to.",0

Cats are one of the biggest threats to the balanced natural fauna. People do not realize that their adorable cats still have strong predator instincts and sometimes kill just for fun. Nowadays more and more people want to have a cat, so millions of little predators are roaming around and decimating local fauna. But hey, they are so cute! Indeed they are, but they are even cuter staying at home. I don't have anything against cats, it's not their fault, it's fault of their owners. 

Here I have something to support my opinion. 
1. In the USA alone cats kill approximately 2.4 BILLIONS of birds every year. 
2. In Australia, hunting by cats helped to drive at least 20 native mammals to extinction, and continues to threaten at least 124 more. 
3. Their introduction has caused the extinction of at least 33 endemic species on islands throughout the world.

Everyone talks about how everyone shouldn't kill other animals and insects because ""they are trying to live their own life"" or ""I feel bad about killing it."" Grow some thick skin and kill it and get over it. Insects can easily be replaced and it's easier to just kill it. They wouldn't hesitate to kill you why should we be hesitant to kill it? We shouldn't.

Why does every post about people killing animals or insects say that when people do they are cold, heartless, monsters that don't deserve to live and be destroyed? A little over dramatic but why does every single one have it? We kill a spider and people want to feel bad about the spider but not the human? What if the spider was deadly? That spider could have killed the human and nobody would bat an eye but if the spider die ""OH HOW COULD YOU KILL AND INNOCENT SPIDER THAT HAD A LIFE AND FAMILY!1!!!"" Learn to take up for your fellow humans since we are the one that helps YOU survive not the animals that you're so worry about dying.

Sports is another thing, sports are good to have fun while doing excercise, wich Is a good thing, most people don't remember why the Roman Coliseum was created, and they keep going or watching colyseums, most people think that doesn't apply to them because, thei're the smart ones because of X Y and z, because they listen to TeddXTalks, or ""Is just to have fun with friends"" but NO thats not the reason, ( even I fall for that sometimes). Is incredibly how heteronormative brainwashed most sports are. There's always ""Thy"" sport that everyone in a specific country/state ""LOVE"" with passion.

They both act as though America's government system is near perfect and devoid of criticism, even with the current events going down in American politics (i.e. BLM rallies.) 

Another reason I believe Texans are the most arrogant Americans I've ever met, is the fact the state had to make it a legislation to wear a mask, and if you do not do so in a public setting you are to be fined $250, this to me just proves to me that Texans are so stubborn their government had to threaten them with a fine just to put on their masks when they're out in public, despite the clear surge of corona cases in the state. 

I had a conversation with a Texan woman who was protesting against wearing a mask in Walmart, and we talked about health care in the UK, and how it was free, she responded to me saying, ""if it's free it's probably not worth having around."" ... Karen, aren't you the one barking about your ""freedom"" to not wear a mask?

Propoganda is a powerful tool. It was used by Hitler and Stalin to bolster support from their people. Which often shows how misleading it is. American propoganda portrays communists as evils and that their society will always crumble, and that communists cause a lot of wars and issues. Even tho a lot of this might be true lmao, I still think it's quite exaggerated, and the concept of communism isn't such a bad idea, it was created to help bring the poor out of poverty.

Adderall is medication for people with frontal lobe disorders such as ADHD, ADD etc and the fact that young people feel the need to take this to focus for exams is extremely concerning.
Another one is the change in content of YouTube and Instagram, which are used for longer periods of time by young people, and hence they're the target audience. If you've watched this content, you might have noticed that they have quick cuts, speak loudly and will occasionally have multiple things popping up on screen.

Either they dont have enough of it, so they dont know. OR they have mismanaged it to the point where they just dont realize.

Money can definitely buy you happiness. Having money is not irrelevant to being happy as they both are inextricably linked. The key is to use that money in such a way where you cultivate long lasting feelings of positivity.

So what are some of the ways you can cultivate long lasting feelings of happiness? Spend money in smaller pleasures - its the little things that matter right! - spending money on smaller purchases but frequently keeps that feeling going. Spend money on donations - gratitude for what you have is a great way to feel better about yourself after the fact - why? because its a fucking powerful feeling to know that you helped contribute to someone else's happiness or needs. Spend money on experiences - You got that lambo...now what?! - the anticipation of an event and preparing to go for that is one of the best feelings ever. And rather than one big event if you decide to go small but frequently(whether its a day trip or a show), you accumulate those experiences that are uniquely yours.  Those memories are better than any damn dusty lambo(also rent one if you really need to experience that flex).  Most importantly - spend money on anything that saves you time! Time is one thing you'll never get back - so why not spend money to increase it for yourself.  Hire people to do chores you dont do - spend money on prepaid meals(or better yet spend a few hours cooking one day and save yourself time during the week), hire a kid to wash your car. If you got a boo then hire a damn sitter rather than spending hours trying to find some jewelry - those hours spent together are way more precious. Spend money on a financial planner so that you can maximize your own money to spend for later!

Yes - spending money on hedonistic tendencies(I have plenty), does give you that spurt of happiness, but I have always felt its never been as long lasting. You get the spike but its there temporarily. Upgrade your life but dont let it waste more time or become a long term money pit.

Don’t spend unnecessarily, don’t lavish anything. I remember even a McDonald’s meal was supposed to be a huge event in my childhood and I was even shy asking for it, maybe on a sunny Saturday once every 2-3 months.

So for one Christmas, when I was 9 or 10, my parents decided to spend 25 euros for a “very expensive” leather soccer ball. They forbid me to play with it with my friends in front of the apartment building, because someone would steal it or it would get scratched on the street’s asphalt. And this is how 15 years passed by, me looking at this gorgeous new soccer ball in the closet and never played with it in my youth. But yesterday the time came! I met with my friends after many years, on a soccer field and I bring my ball. The first time one guy touches it, decides to shoot it up high to “test it”, the ball tears the net above the field and lands on the street nearby. A truck came over it and blew it. That was it. No more than a minute. I didn’t even shoot it once.

I don’t care about the ball, I just care about the opportunities, stories, experiences and fun I missed as a young boy by saving this ball from the bad things that can happen to it. Who I saved it from? Myself?

Being risen like this is also having more damaging consequences for me. I am 25 and I make what 0.2% of the people in my country earn, and I can’t make my brain comfortable spending 1-2k euros for a vacation. Not that the money is the problem, just that spending it makes me miserable, unhappy and filled with hatred. I can’t enjoy it.

So people risen in the same manners as me, wear your new clothes now! Don’t leave everything for the future. You are alive now. There is no guarantee tomorrow will come!",0

She is rude and arrogant teenager, who is aware of her power and dark nature. She likes to show her powers around, and basically saying: ""I'm better than you!""

Wow. Spoiled and rude Mary Sue protagonist. Great thing to do when you want to make the MC unwatchable. And I'm sure she is going to stay the same annoying little crap at the end of this Season.

2.

>Rey is a loner, and doesn't likes romance. She got her friend Ben in a friend zone, but later, was too proud to accept that she felt in love with him.

So, she is an ""edgy loner teenager""? Yeah, no. Fuck off. Also, the MC manipulates other people's feelings. Perfect.

3.

>But also, she is a very difficult character, with flaws sticking everywhere out of her - she wants her power to be recognised, and always wants more. She has teenager problems - like when she wants to be able to go on missions herself, not with the help of her Master - Luke.

THIS is **not** a complex character. This is a spoiled brat.

THIS is **not** a teenager. This is a dream of a little puberty girl who doesn't know how people function.

>Rey had a breakdown when realised what Dark Side truly is, when she **tried to kill Leia**, who just wanted to calm her down.

Yeah, not a Leia fun, but the MC has almost *murdered* a positive character!!! Why the heck we are supposed to root for Rey?!

Wow... This certainly the ""best fix"" in the entire universe.

Come on, you REALLY want a spoiled, arrogant and bitchy protagonist? Give me a break. That's why The Legends Of Korra was criticised the most - for having a spoiled and arrogant girl protagonist!

I'm sure, that IF Season 3 is going to come out, Rey is still going to be a Mary Sue as before, just much more unwatchable. She isn't supposed to even exist.

Also, she wasn't even properly written, and some people are already calling this ""new"" Rey better than the original. BS.

But animals also have intelligence and are capable of feelings. Take a look at /r/happycowgifs. I don’t know how anyone who is subscribed to that sub can eat a cow in good conscience. As a matter of fact, animals by nature are more innocent than humans, because of the very fact that they are not capable of reason. 

As far as plants go, ok...I get that a hunan’s life is worth more than a blade of grass. But where do you draw the line? Is one human life worth more than all the blades of grass on earth?

Apparently the Venus fly trap is only found in North Carolina. If you removed all the Venus fly traps in the world, you would probably induce major damage to the local ecosystems. Is a human life still worth more than that?

I’m a straight A student, high honors and recognitions in my country. I’ve always been asked about why I didn’t apply to Ivy schools in the US as I had the grades and extracurriculars and everything to do so. My answer has always been that I would never like to either study or live there and here’s why.

After years of reading stories about student debt, rapes in campus and social injustice in a great scale, with most colleges or universities siding with whomever gets to give more money I have come to the conclusion that they don’t give a shit about future generations. By “they” I mean the government, the system, the schools. Don’t get me wrong, there’s always the exception, but in a big scale, that country just seems like pure normalized hatred and bigotry to me. 

Why not give more attention to schools in more progressive countries that have the same level and even better educations? 

My own country, even though not even close to perfect, has very good schools and don’t get the recognition they deserve, as well as schools in other less-recognized countries.

For those that don’t know, there’s basically been a bunch of allegations (many not all are proven true with supporting evidence) that the Smash community is infested with sex creeps and pedophiles where its’ top players are the offenders. 

There’s been a broad range of allegations that have happened from serious stuff such as Rape to small but still disgusting stuff such as asking for nudes from minors. [Here’s the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/hjfv0y/summary_of_sexual_and_nonsexual_allegations/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

Im specifically talking about the most famous Smash player who is Zer0. He was the best Smash 4 player and was a popular streamer up until the allegations. He solicited nudes from minors and knew their age but still asked for them anyway. Apparently, this applies for at least 1 of the victims but nudes were never actually sent. He also showed some nude hentai art to underage girls as a playful joke or prank idk. He was 19 and above when these happened. You can read more below

[A summary of what Zer0 did](https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/hllzwo/new_post_by_jisu_the_truth_about_zero_katie_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

What I’m getting at is that I think that while I think what Zer0 did was disgusting, I don’t think it’s completely unforgiving. Yes, it’s creepy and almost illegal as the nudes weren’t actually sent. But Zer0 has seemed to have changed since then as he did those things years ago and doesn’t seem like he’s still doing them. He’s got a girlfriend or wife idk and seems to treat her nice as she has admitted. 

I think those past acts were done because he was not really thinking straight as he had to fill his urge of getting off and he didn’t really go about it the right way. Maybe, he didn’t realise how severe of a mistake asking for nudes from a minor is and it’s legality issues. He was young and maybe for the first time, a girl was interested in him as he was socially awkward and a nerd. People ask for nudes on the internet and do creepy shit all the time. He has the misfortune of being ousted now but I really don’t think he’s the same person as he was then. 

Straight up, I’m not gonna lie that what Zero did is disgusting but he doesn’t strike me as that kind of person now. I know he did those things in the past but he doesn’t seem like he still does those things and he probably feels ashamed of it anyway. I actually feel that he has grown from it.

As an example, Gandhi was almost the same as Zer0 but actually did worse things. Gandhi was a racist by supporting the Aryan race and [a pedohile as he slept with little girls NUDE](https://www.colombotelegraph.com/index.php/gandhi-used-his-position-to-sexually-exploit-young-women/amp/) If many more people knew, he would probably not be seen in such a positive light by many people

Yet, Gandhi did great things for India overall so do his wrongdoings matter? That’s up to you and many would say no. I am not saying he is excused but I’m just saying that people can do really bad things but also do good as well

TLDR; a creep online who doesn’t physically meet up with girls is disgusting but should not be cancelled or deemed unforgivable. Zer0 deserves a second chance as I think he’s still a decent guy.",0

4. If suspect someone is lying about their race, how do you prove/disprove it? Genetic testing? Genealogy research? Or do you have someone trained to accurately guess people's race just by looking at them?
5. Is there a regulatory body that audits the school's diversity? If so what measures do they use?

I know this is a lot of questions, but I am genuinely curious as this ""holistic"" approach seems very mysterious to me.",0

However, according to this more detailed document by the ICE:
https://www.ice.gov/doclib/sevis/pdf/bcm2007-01.pdf

intl students of schools that operate a hybrid model face the opposite problem: they cannot remain in their home country to take a fully online course load and must come to the US to take at least one in-person class. The relevant excerpt from the document is here:

> 3) Students attending schools adopting a hybrid model—that is, a mixture of online and in
person classes—will be allowed to take more than one class or three credit hours online.
These schools must certify to SEVP, through the Form I-20, “Certificate of Eligibility for
Nonimmigrant Student Status,” that the program is not entirely online, that the student is **not
taking an entirely online course load** for the fall 2020 semester, and that the student is taking 
the minimum number of online classes required to make normal progress in their degree
program. The above exemptions do not apply to F-1 students in English language training
programs or M-1 students, who are not permitted to enroll in any online courses 

and


> Only students enrolled at a school that is **only
offering online coursework** can engage in remote learning from their home country. In this case,
DSOs should annotate the student’s record to make it clear that the student is outside the US but
taking full time online courses as that is the only choice offered by the school.

This is of course just as bad of a policy as the one that applies to online-only schools, possibly even more so, since far more schools will be going hybrid after this announcement, but for many students it's not possible or practical to fly to the US, basically diving into a pandemic hotzone, just to keep student status. I personally know many students who have flown home during/before the summer and can't fly back in the near future because of health/travel restrictions and visa availability.

Just thought I'd let you all know since this is being buried behind the main headline of this new policy.",0

I emailed my english teacher from sophomore year two weeks into summer (almost two weeks ago) and she still hasn't replied, so I'm not quite sure what to make of that because, on one hand, it's summer, and on the other, it's been quite a while. We haven't been in touch, I went to see her once during all of junior year before COVID-19. Not ideal.

My junior year AP Lang teacher said she was closed for recs two weeks before summer and I'm wondering if it's worth it to see if she would write me a letter? I didn't ask at the time because I didn't think I stood out too much in a classroom full of amazing people and I never got to present that one project that I put sweat and tears into. 

So after English I should probably ask a STEM teacher, right? Well this is where it sucks because the one (or two) teacher(s) I know has favorable opinion of me is again, a sophomore year teacher (AP Chem and honors algebra II). I've sort of been in touch with both junior year but little more than greetings, so again, not ideal. Then there's my AP Bio teacher from this year; she knows who I am at least, she's written me a rec already for a summer program I didn't get into, and she's amazingly nice. 

Are my rec letters going to be the end of me? (jk but not really) Is the middle of the summer a bad time to email a teacher about recs? Should I put asking off until the first week of school?

I know many people have been theorizing how acceptance rates are likely to fall for the next cycle, given that many people in the class of 2024 are defering to the class of 2025 due to COVID-19. On top of that, since many schools are test optional, I’d imagine more people would apply to better colleges since they no longer are restricted by their SAT/ACT scores. 

How far do you think acceptance rates to T10 and T20 universities will drop? For me in particular, I’m worried about Duke since that’s where I’m EDing. 

Let me know what you think.

Edit: Decided to do some math. Say 750 out of the roughly 2,170 student Duke class of 2024 who RDed decide to defer, that would lower slots in the new class by 21% assuming they accept roughly the same amout of kids. With a 5.7% acceptance rate, that lowers admissions to 3.7%.",0

For example someone from UMich could totally wear UMich gear and say ""Go Blue"" and yeah maybe it'd be a little obnoxious if they went overboard lol but totally acceptable and honestly, kinda part of the fun of going there. But for example if someone says ""I'm so proud to go to Princeton, it's the best!!!"" it just kinda rubs me the wrong way? Lol

If you go to Harvard and you have too much school pride it's like... Ok we get it, you're flexing.

Princeton and Duke, same boat, it kinda has that pretentious/snobby feel.

With Yale and Columbia maybe the vibe is sliiiightly less pretentious, weirdly.

I feel like UChicago people who have too much school pride are just soooo eager to let you know they're so \~\~intellectual and quirky\~\~

If someone from Penn has too much school pride I think of Wharton and evil people lmaoooo like... it's Slytherin or something.

The only schools where I feel like it's kosher to have school pride (and again I know this is the most unscientific thing ever) are Stanford, Northwestern and to a lesser extent MIT and Caltech? IDK why I feel that way about Stanford, maybe because it has a sports culture? Because it's sunny? Same with Northwestern sorta, for me it feels more wholesome??? Again *I have no idea why*. MIT and Caltech are like... damn OK you're a genius so yes please flex but don't flex too hard because it legitimately freaks me out how smart you are.

&#x200B;

In this highlight, I will be talking about Grinnell College!  One warning I will give before beginning this one is that I am currently committed to Grinnell, so this is definitely going to have some bias.  However, I hope it helps for those who are aware of the school and interested but don't know much about the school.  Here are some great things about Grinnell:

* Generally ranks in T15 liberal art colleges and USNWR ranks Grinnell #3 for undergrad teaching out off all LACs.
* The application is free.  The one caveat unfortunately to is is that they require official ACT and SAT scores, which will cost some money, but if you are really interested in Grinnell, it'll be cheaper to apply here than many other peer universities and LACs.
* Student faculty ratio is 9:1, 65% of classes are fewer than 20 students, more than 90% of classes are fewer than 30 students, and the average class size is 17.
* Offers b[oth amazing need based and merit financial aid.](https://www.grinnell.edu/admission/financial-aid/affording-grinnell/scholarships)  Grinnell meets full demonstrated need for both domestic and international students.  Furthermore, if you are an Iowan in-state student, you are guaranteed a $48K merit scholarship ($12K/year) and have an opportunity to receive the Iowa Tuition Grant.  If you are a domestic student who is accepted Early Decision 1 or 2, you are guaranteed a $40K merit scholarship ($10K/year).  You can earn a merit aid up to $100K ($25K/year) regardless of whether you are domestic or international as long as you apply by December 1.
* If you love Brown, Amherst, Vassar, Wesleyan, the University of Rochester, Smith, or Hamilton because of their [open curriculums](https://blog.collegevine.com/open-curriculum-schools-11-colleges-that-allow-students-to-direct-their-own-learning/), Grinnell has it too, which they call the [**individually advised curriculum**.](https://www.grinnell.edu/admission/why-grinnell/academics/individually-advised)  Grinnell's open curriculum makes it so that the only required course is a 4 and a half credit course known as the First Year Tutorial and the First Year Experience Course and courses required to complete a major.  Other than that, you can take anything you would like without worrying about graduation requirements.
* Although Grinnell does require a class before graduation, which is known as the **First Year Tutorial,** chances are that it won't feel like a required course because Grinnell offers around 30 courses each year that count as a tutorial.  You can read more about the First Year Tutorial [here](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/experience/tutorial), but the First Year Tutorial is a class made to create college level writing skills, and the topics are extremely creative.  For example, this year, some of the topics they are offering are The Liberal Arts as a Force for Evil, Numbers, Chocolate from Ghana to Grinnell, Ghost Stories, Songs of Hope, Babylon Berlin, Learning and Unlearning How to Tell Time, Stuff, Food, Energy, and many more.  In past years, they even offered tutorials such as Adulting, Missing Out, The Cult of Grinnell, Lord of the Rings, and A Critical Analysis of Pokemon.
* Your first year tutorial professor serves as your academic advisor and counselor until you declare a major meaning that it is easy to work with your tutorial professor!
* There's no graduate school meaning professors are focused on teaching over conducting research, and they are also extremely willing to work with undergraduates.  It's really common for a undergraduate, even in the hardcore humanities such as linguistics, literature, etc. to have the opportunity to pursue research.  In fact, they have a program called [MAPS](https://www.grinnell.edu/about-grinnell/leadership-and-administration/offices-and-services/deans-office/mentored-advanced-3) in which students have the chance to pursue research with a professor over the summer or during the school year.  Grinnell treats it like employment as well!
* Study abroad programs are abundant and affordable.  Grinnell even offers two programs of their own known as [Grinnell in London (GIL)](https://www.grinnell.edu/global/learning/ocs/gil) and [Grinnell in Washington (GIW)](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/global/global-learning/campus-study/grinnell-washington).  GIL allows students to study in London with Grinnellian professors and take Grinnell classes in London, while GIW allows students to do the same thing in Washington, D.C by directly enrolling in conjugation with American University.  If you'd rather go somewhere else or you want to try spending time with another institution, there's so many approved options.  In fact, they have a database [here](https://travel.global.grinnell.edu/index.cfm?FuseAction=Programs.ListAll), with options available but not limited to Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan; Russia; Morocco; Hungary; China; the Czech Republic; Ireland; the U.K.; Yonsei University in Seoul, South Korea; Germany; Italy; New Zealand; Greece; Argentina; and many more.  If you are interested in a study abroad program that isn't offered, you can even petition for another one, meaning you still have a chance to study abroad with that program for a semester or a year.
* Graduate school outcomes are incredible.  [90% of Grinnellians who apply for graduate school are admitted into their first or second choices.](https://www.grinnell.edu/after-grinnell/graduate-outcomes-all-majors)  Going through the list of grad school acceptances of a previous graduating class, many Grinnellians attend graduate schools like The University of Cambridge, Columbia, Johns Hopkins, Northwestern, UChicago, Yale, Cornell, Harvard, University of Iowa, University of Minnesota, and many more.
* For those who are interested in employment after undergrad rather than graduate school, [the employment is fantastic as well!](https://www.grinnell.edu/after-grinnell/graduate-outcomes-all-majors)  Many students work at Amazon, Amazon Studios, Bank of America, Epic, Federal Reserve Banks, Goldman Sachs, Google (13 students ended up getting jobs here right out of graduation!), Japan Exchange Teaching,. Microsoft, ScribeAmerica, Smithsonian, Teach for America, and many universities!   
* Lots of [participation in fellowships](https://www.grinnell.edu/after-grinnell/graduate-outcomes-all-majors).  A lot of Grinnellians participate in the Fullbright Program and Thomas J. Watson Foundation.  In fact, there's been 119 Fullbright Scholars since 2005, 14 Rhode Scholars, 5 Marshall Scholars, 13 Goldwater Scholars, and 1 Noble Laureate.
* Really amazing alumni network.  Some of the alumni are not limited to but include actor and writer Kumail Nanjiani, Intel co-founder Robert Noyce, chemist Thomas Cech, actor Gary Cooper, theatrical producer Hallie Flanagan, Sudanese revolutionist John Garang, poet Amy Clampitt, pianist Herbie Hancock, and many more.
* **Home to the political science major!  Grinnell was actually the first university in the U.S. to offer one!**  
* **For those humanities inclined,** Grinnell offers some concentrations (minors at Grinnell) like Peace and Conflict Studies, American Studies, etc. and is well known for their English major.  For those interested in literary analysis and rhetorical analysis, especially, the English major at Grinnell focuses on those two content areas a lot!
* **For those who are STEM inclined**, Grinnell offers the 3-2 Engineering Program, allowing you to get a BA from Grinnell and a BS/BE degree from Columbia, Caltech, RPI, or Washington University in St. Louis.  You can check out the requirements [here.](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-and-concentrations/physics/3-2-engineering-program)  In addition, many pre-meds find the open curriculum useful as it allows you to have more space in your schedule to take electives or other courses they find interesting.  They also have [a minor (known as a concentration at Grinnell) known as Science, Medicine, and Society,](https://www.grinnell.edu/academics/majors-concentrations/science-medicine-society) which is super cool for those who are pre-med but like both STEM and the humanities.
* **For those who are business inclined**, Grinnell may not offer a business major, but it is a feeder into many top business schools for MBA, and is well regarded for its economics major.  In addition, Warren Buffet makes routine visits to the college to speak to students because he is well connected to Grinnell and even served on the Board of Trustees.
* Extremely international friendly.  Around 20% of the student population is international.  
* For those who want to study a language other than English that is more on the niche side, you can participate in the [Alternate Language Study Program (ALSP) or the Alternate Language Study Option (ALSO)](https://catalog.grinnell.edu/preview_entity.php?catoid=16&ent_oid=1583&returnto=3303) once you reach your second year, maintain a 2.75 GPA, and have taken at least 3 years of a world language in high school, 1 year at Grinnell, or a class in Linguistics.  
* **Very interdisciplinary!**  Because of the open curriculum, they encourage pursuing interdisciplinary study and taking academic risks.   Due to this, you are allowed to audit to take courses without credit if you want to have the chance to attend the lectures without getting credit, and there are many courses offered that are made for non-majoring students.  For example, the Physics Department at Grinnell offers a class called How to Learn Physics every other year, where students interested in Physics but are worried about its difficulty or struggled with it in high school can take it to learn about it in a less daunting method.  If you wish to take a more challenging course such as General Physics, you can do that as well.
* **An extremely inclusive student community.**  They have lots of student organizations for minorities, internationals, first generation students, Questbridge and economically disadvantaged students, and LGBTQIA+ students in efforts to provide help and assistance.  

I hope this helped!  Please let me know if you have questions about Grinnell!  I would be happy to talk about the school.

Best of luck to all the rising seniors applying!  I truly hope you all get into your first choice schools.

Fellow international high school junior here.  My country is currently in lock down and I am thinking of undertaking some sort of economics project with my new free time. I want to demonstrate commitment to my major for AOs.

I have taken Calculus 1-3, Linear Algebra, and ODEs at my local university, and have self studied statistical inference by Hogg and Craig up to Hypothesis Testing and Econometric analysis by Greene up to Heteroscedasticity. However, since I will receive no official academic credit for my self studied courses, I recognize that AOs wouldn't consider it. I am therefore looking for a way to apply what I have learnt in some sort of project to boost my application. Do you guys happen to know where I may post my findings to establish some academic credibility in my work? 

Also, would undertaking replications of papers such as Mankiw, Romer, and Weil (1992) be valuable for an application? Appreciate if you guys could help. Thanks.",0

And even for those that have in-person classes, we’ll hardly be able to make friends, or interact with other people. There won’t be any clubs, there surely won’t be any sports. It’ll be some dystopian vision of the future come to life. People spaced 10 desks apart, gloved and masked, taking notes from a professor screen-casting into the room.

I was looking forward to college. I haven’t been to school in years— not since 6th grade —but somehow I got into college. The biggest reason I applied was not even to further some future career, but because I am incredibly lonely. Maybe that makes me sound weak or soft, but you don’t know how it feels. My parents are crazy, literally insane. I haven’t left the house in years. I have no friends, no one to talk to, nothing to look forward to. I literally sit inside the house all day. The lights off, the curtains shuttered. My father drinks heavily, so we have to keep the house dark for him— he say’s it “hurts his head”. I’m a literal hand-maid. I spend all day fetching things for people or cooking or cleaning. My grandfather, who lives with us, has an extensive collection of hand guns I have to look after. They need oiling twice a week.

They tried to stop me from going to college. They destroyed my social security card and my birth certificate, and I spent months fighting to get ahold of new copies. When they realized I was progressing, they did everything they could to convince—or scare—me into going to community college part-time so I could stay at home most days, instead of moving out of state.

I felt proud when I started receiving acceptances. I was excited to learn some of my best financial aid offers were from really nice out-of-state schools. And, most of all, I was excited to forget about everything in the past and overcome depression. Now, I know a lot of people these days claim to have depression. Most people don’t know \*real\* depression. I feel completely unmotivated. I can hardly push myself to do anything. It’s like being exhausted, but a million times worse. Some days I can’t sleep, other days I can hardly wake up. I can’t eat. For some time I was barely 110 lbs yet a smidge over 6 foot tall. I don’t have suicidal thoughts— I have the everyday realization that if I just wrapped an extension cord over the door I wouldn’t have to face tomorrow.

I just want a life. I want my own friends, like my siblings do. Like the other kids across the street. Like every other 19-year-old in America. I was almost there, and only months from finally getting the only thing I ever wanted in life, a new age of “social distancing” is ushered in. Half the year will be in person, but there will hardly be anything personal about it. The other half I’ll have to do online. I don’t even know how i’ll pull that off, here at home.

I can’t handle another year of this. I just want a normal life for one day. I’d do anything for one day.",0

The other thing is that there's another set of people who know me as the most quiet, empathetic, sensitive, (maybe shy too) and the most caring person. I feel like I end up shutting myself down to the rest of the world whenever such an argument happens within my close circle of people. Because of self esteem issues stemming from what's happening at home (or inside me and the self critic), I end up being a totally quiet person, I guess. Maybe from the fear of not making a mistake again.

Seriously, I want to know.",2,1,"          Here's the thing. For the longest time, I have been obsessed with finding the problems with things. Mostly, it was a result of me trying to find what was wrong in my day to day life, because something definitely was. The more I thought about it, the more I realized that, in fact, many of the issues revolved around the fact that i had become complicit in a life that I truly did not want for myself. The typical 9/5 lifestlye, or in my case public education (I'm only 16 as of right now), just wasn't giving me what I needed.

          It took Covid to get me to realize something crucial. That the fun things in life... they are the truly meaningful ones. Contrary to what we are told, or even come to expect from ourselves, the boring, mundane tasks that fill our lives aren't the reason we exist. After all, isn't the reason most people work so hard on their job or education simply to get these somehow 'forbidden' experiences, the ones we've told ourselves are only accesible on special occasions? One thing I know is that in 50 or 60 years, lying on my deathbed, my regrets will not include my missing homework or days taken off work- in fact, some of my best memories may well have occured during the time I set aside for these reasons.

          Now, in the context of Covid, I think it more important now than ever to live, laugh, and to love. To embrace that new hobby or old obsession. To give meaning to those guilty pleasures and lost crabings. Because you know what? Your life is truly about you. What you do with it, is truly your choice. So I urge you, from the bottom of my heart and from the depths of my soul... go forth, have fun, make good memories, express your love to family and friends, and above all- be happy. 

          And to start that process, why not answer this simple question: What makes YOU happy?",0

i have been friends with “Ash” for i would say nearly 10 years. basically we were best friends. we have the same friends. we are in the same college together. we’re pretty similar, have very similar interests and we just got along really well. we both never had boyfriends before either which i think bonds people together to be honest. despite that i would say our friendship lacked communication. whenever one of us would get annoyed, it would be quite passive aggressive. she used to go on twitter and passive aggressively tweet stuff that i know was about me, lol. i’ve deleted my Twitter since. 

anyway, in college she introduced me to one of her guy friends. him and i eventually got together (we’ve been together for around 2 years now). i have always noticed “jealous” or whatever you call it, tendencies, with my friend but this was really when i think was so obvious. she started to leave all our group chats with my boyfriend, lol. she would stop hanging out with us.. i never felt like it was because my boyfriend and i were PDA. the most we did in public was hug and hold hands. i even got to the point where i asked my boyfriend if we could stop holding hands and stuff just so Ash wouldnt feel left out or anything. i soon came to realise that i shouldn’t have needed to do that. 

a few months later, she would tell us that she will only meet up with us but if we start to “make me (her) feel bad, I will leave”. when we asked her why she said that, she just ignored it. that really made me so furious! 

on top of that, i noticed her talk to me less and less. she went to another country for college and was feeling alone. that’s when i noticed her talking to me more and more, lol. at this point, I was already tired of giving so much energy to someone who didn’t reciprocate. i replied to her and felt that i was there but i know i wasn’t being genuine. i was there for her because i wanted to help, not because i really cared? why would I be there for her when she stopped being there for me when I was at my happiest? that took me a while to realise. 

fast forward to now, she came back here from her year abroad and is not lonely anymore, stopped talking to me. i don’t talk to her either because as i said above, nothing was reciprocated and i felt used. we only talk in group chats with our other friends. 

of course i do have my bad traits as a friend too but i feel like i was a good friend to her.

It was broad daylight, and I was sitting down on the floor, staring down at the stairs with my little cousins.

Very difficult to describe but everything was that cool-blue daylight color, I guess because of the windows, sunlight and white walls.

Anyways there I was, just staring at the stairs with my cousins (7&11)

I was just looking down at them when suddenly I started panicking and telling my little cousins that no matter what comes up the stairs to not let the doors close. (There was a door on each side of the wall)

And we stood there waiting

Nothing happened for a long time and then suddenly I left the scene and went to do something that I can’t remember (I think it was to get a jacket from the closet) but I left them and told them to hold open the doors with all of their strength 

Then I woke up

But not completely

Every summer has been bliss for me, as I’ve been able to hear what a lot of locals consider ‘noise pollution.’ But it couldn’t be any further from that for me. It’s reminiscence through and through. 

This summer came what feels like early-ish and for the first month I really thought this wasn’t going to be a cicada year (whatever that is, if it is real).

I’ve tried watching it recently (like, in the past year) and even the Netflix reboot mini-series and..... I don’t even know what I liked about it to start with. It just sounds so contrived and over-acted. The characters all kinda seem unlikeable, and it was just hard to watch.

I don’t know if *I* just changed since I originally was a fan, or if the whole world is just *that* different now, but that show didn’t hold up for me. 

Like it was decently popular back in the day, so I have to assume that it was just a tv show of the times.

And the first few months were alright, managed going along but then came the lay offs from jobs, my entire friend circle (or atleast the friends I hold dear) have been laid off. And since this is not our country and we're here on work visas, they had to leave.

So anyway now my circle from 6 has been reduced to 2. An I kind of just started my career in the month of February (this year), and they sacked me in March (last week, April first week). It has taken quite a heavy mental toll on me. Specially as I sold everything in my ""home"" country to come here and find new ventures.

So I am mostly alone at home, haven't even gotten the chance to say goodbye to my friends as well, the lockdown is in effect.

I managed to kill time during the first 2 months and well I got by. The only reason I haven't gotten kicked out of here is because my parents work here too, and they are hanging on my a thread. We don't talk much as I haven't been in the same place as them for over 8 years. Even our conversations are limited, and well I'm no more thefree bird I used to be as compared to my time when I was away during college (I used to manage myself completely) and now I'm entirely dependant on them, feels like I'm an infant all over again. 

I miss being an adult and being my own man and solving my own issues and even having the small graces of talking to my friends and making contacts. Now as I live under my parents roof, I have to adhere to their rules.

I don't mean to diss them, I have high respect for them, but they are more of authority figures in my file and I can't talk to them about everything and the mental pressure I face on a daily basis.

SO ANYWAY, COMING BACK TO TOPIC,

For the past 2 weeks, I've constantly been plagues by Nightmares and I can't even sleep peacefully. Every nap is a horrible dream. The only time I sleep well is when everyone in the house is awake and there is noise around me (this was never the person I was, I'm used to sleeping only in complete darkness and silence).

I don't know how to make these nightmares stop.

I was wondering if anyone else faces the same and if I am normal of if I seriously need to seek help.

A couple of weeks ago, I was told that I was gonna need surgery to my groin area. I have always struggled with phimosis and it has run my self-esteem down quite a bit. It took me a long time to accept the fact. I’ve never had surgery in my life besides getting my wisdom teeth removed and the thought especially to such an area horrified me. I felt hopeless and sick. Now, the night before, I’ve become more content with getting this procedure done.

Although, I’ve never been so stressed in my life than these past few weeks. So much to consider, from the medications to the driving around to the mental anguish I experienced. I feel somewhat relieved to be having all of this finally done and over with. The procedure itself is upwards of a thousand dollars, but I know my future self will be thanking me a million times over.

The recovery process will be a whole ordeal by itself, but it will hopefully come and go. I just received my first amiibo for Smash Ultimate (Ness) and will be keeping myself busy during recovery! Things come and go, and like this surgery, they all come to end. To a different life path!",0

I got some milk ready for my daughter, left some bottles with her and took the day for myself.

I went to a local coffee shop and got my favorite drink,  with a croissant, then drove to the park with my camera and sat by the boat docks and just took a bunch of photos with my drink and snack next to me. I sat there for hours and just let the fresh air clear my mind before I got up and went for a little walk. I had my phone on do not disturb (but checked occasionally to make sure my daughter was okay, of course).

After I finished my time at the park, I grabbed some dinner for my mom and I and after I put my daughter to bed we watched a movie together.

Being a new mom is so tough, especially with some things that have been going on. But today was amazing, and I felt like myself again.

All of us are 18-19 if that matters.

But I feel like our group has trouble committing to hanging out. I understand people are busier now with university, but even so we haven't met as a group (there's 4 of us) for probably over a year now. The only exception is when they get together to drink (I don't drink and I'm not really into the crowd they drink with).

I understand sometimes you have to give a little for the good of the group. You're never going to satisfy everyone (one person doesn't like chinese food, one doesn't want to take the bus for an hour) so it's good to be open when making plans.

But even then I feel like every time one of us asks to hang out in our group chat. One or two people respond and the others just leave it on read. For example last week one of my friends was off work and asked if anyone wanted to go out for dinner. Even though I wasn't really in the mood I said yes, but the others just left it on read.

Today I asked if anyone wants to meet this weekend to play boardgames. One replied and the others just left it on read.

Again, I understand that not everyone will always want to do something, but I feel like my friends never get together for anything other than drinking/getting high. I don't blame friend x if he doesn't want to bus an hour to get dinner, has a lot of work to do or isn't interested in playing some complicated 3 hour boardgame. But regardless of the activity it just seems like nobody wants to commit.

They express interest in doing stuff, but we never actually commit to anything. I don't want to be overbearing and keep asking them; if anything I'd rather they just say no.

https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/hml323/graphic_design_or_social_work/,CasualConversation,ifearbears,1594114187,Graphic design or social work?,2,1,"Hi all! I’m 18F and confused about what career I’d like.

I live in Ontario and I was enrolled in the social service worker program at Fleming college for fall 2020, then decided to withdraw until 2021 due to covid. Now with a year to rethink my decision, I’ve really been looking into graphic design.

I love art and am good at it. My friends tell me I remind them of Amy from Brooklyn 99 because I get excited about new pens/notebooks and really love organizing powerpoints. I seriously have fun making presentations look good and choosing colours that go well together. I always spent extra time on my projects in high school to make them look more aesthetically pleasing. I used to want to do animation, but I was worried about the lack of jobs. I would love to be able to make things have a nice layout and be more visually pleasing for a job, alongside being able to use my art skills. 

I also wanted to do social work because I wanted to help people. So many of my friends have gone through hard times regarding their families or mental health, and I thought it would be great to be able to help other people experiencing the same things. But I would be in college for 2 years, then university for another 2 to get my bachelors. I can’t go straight to uni because I took lower level math courses in high school. (I’m extremely bad at math and science, I’ve always had more of an aptitude for English, history and the arts.)

The more I read about social work the more uneasy I get. It’s incredibly stressful, long hours, low-ish pay. I would be in a fairly substantial amount of debt by the time I got my degree, and might have trouble finding a job so that I can use it. 

I know graphic design isn’t the highest paying job either, but I think I would enjoy it. I’d also like to start a family in my mid twenties and graphic design would most likely allow me to work from home. I wouldn’t want to pay $50k for a social work degree and have to put off having a kids because I can’t afford it. 

So which do you think is a better decision long term? Do I need a university degree to do well in graphic design or is a college diploma ok?",0

Meeting new people is a completely new thing for me, so when I meet someone new, its all I can think about (or overthink about).

Has anybody else consciously noticed a change in yourself?",5,0.86,"Because of COVID, it accelerated the already inevitable personality shift I was experiencing from extroversion to introversion. Three years ago, I would never have believed that one day I would enjoy staying at home every evening. 

I grew up growing vegetables, fruits, etc. outdoors, plus a variety of other plants. It’s resparked the green thumb in me (I haven’t been able to plant anything outside for three years due to living situations) and now I have 40+ houseplants that are thriving. It brings me so much joy to grow things and take care of them. 

I’m much more empathetic to those around me. I would have considered myself empathetic before, but now the hate and hurt overwhelms me so much that I have to be careful how much time I spend on social media or reading the news, or even talking about it with my partner or our family. I deleted my Facebook app and have been checking it for a few minutes a couple times a week. I get social anxiety and I find myself without the mental strength to carry on casual conversations. I can feel the tension everyone is holding when I go out in public to the store. 

The type of TV and movies that I enjoy has taken a huge turn. I used to love deep, intricate storylines. Sci-fi, fantasy, psychological thrillers, anything that mindfucks me. I feel like because I’m so emotionally drained from the world, heavy story lines are just too much for me to handle and I can’t pay attention to them. I’ve wanted to watch nothing but comedy lately, specifically Canadian comedy (Letterkenny and Trailer Park Boys). I started Futurama again, and have been rewatching some of my favorite Southpark seasons as well. The Office has also been a fun new discovery I’ve never taken a liking to in the past but now enjoy. They say laughter is the best medicine, and watching move comedy has helped me cope. 

I am typically an avid reader but I haven’t finished a single book since February. With all this new found time on my hands, I’ve been painting much more, spending more time outside, and I have also been learning flow art, hooping specifically, to give me something meditative and low impact for exercise, and just something new to learn (I have to constantly have goals and projects, I can’t just sit around all day). 

 Birdwatching! I used to sit and watch my grandmothers multiple bird feeders when I was a kid, and she’s teach me about all of them. Although I always have a few feeders out, I’ve had to time to sit outside in the mornings and watch them, or how certain birds will come around in the afternoon or evening, and how they interact with one another. We watched a nest of wrens grown up and fly away right on our front porch. It’s been nice to connect with the nature that around me. 

My partner surprised me with a turntable, so we started a vinyl collection. Every once in a while on a random weekday (we plot when we think there will be less crowds and people), we’ll wear our masks and go antiquing for vinyls, and it’s been such a new and exciting hobby that we both enjoy so much. We’ve been excited to build this collection together.

I'll be turning 25 soon and I've always wanted to move out of my home-city and this was my chance. But, of course, the pandemic happened. My school will be online and it's unclear if I'll be able to get into Canada since the borders are closed. I have the option to defer and at first I would never have considered it but now when I think of the possibility of doing my coursework and working as a teaching assistant from my home-city, it sounds so miserable. The lease on my apartment ends right when I was supposed to be moving and if I have to stay in the US I might have to live with my parents until the border opens. Living with them is really bad for my mental health for a lot of complicated reasons and the total opposite of what I thought my grad school experience would be.
If I deferred I thought about doing a volunteer program like Americorps in another state- this world be my chance to still move away and save money and get a scholarship for school. 
It's always been my dream to move away and going to Canada was perfect since I wanted to leave the US but it was close enough that I could drive back home if I needed to.
I feel pressure to follow through on leaving this year because I feel like I'd be letting myself down if I didn't move, since it is my dream. But with the pandemic I'm scared to move far from my family and I'm scared it'll be hard to meet new people and I'll be lonely and possibly in lockdown again in another state.
I'm considering doing Americorps from my home-city and getting another apartment and deferring school for a year. I don't feel bad about deferred because I'm hopeful that things in Canada can go back to hybrid/ in-person classes by next year and I'll be able to move there by then.
But I feel like a loser for wanting to stay in my home-city another year, mostly out of fear (virus, loneliness) and I don't want the stress of moving so far two times. 
Part of me wants change really bad but I'm scared of it too.
I know if I could go to Canada and things were back to normal I would go but it looks like my options are limited to the US- either my home-city or another state.

I can't move to where my school is but I potentially could move to another state.

For instance, I just realized how last year, I used to travel alone by cab quite late at night, after a night out with a friend, or maybe by myself. My country is not safe for women in general, but that city is considered safer for women. But now when I think about it, it's terrifying. So what if a city was ""considered safer for women"" out of all the other cities in the country? Bad eggs are everywhere and they're not going to draw the line for themselves because of frickin' geography. It was a city I did not even know very well. I broke my own rules of using public transport and traveling during day time and going places where there were several other people. I don't know what came over me and made me think I was even physically strong enough to put up a fight if someone did something to me.

Have you done something like this in your life? Why do you think you felt brave? I guess the reason why you realize it was stupid and dangerous was that you grew older/more mature.

Dachshunds are very expensive, and you usually have to find a breeder and pay a lot of money for them. Anyways, next we got our dog cowboy, who you can find if you dig through my post history, who is a Catahoula cur, and is often complimented as a very handsome dog, with his multi color coat and different color eyes. He is very nice, and has only acted aggressive towards a kid who was sacking him with a stick. Then, my mom got me a dog named Riley, who is a Catahoula who may or may not be mixed with a Doberman. She is a very pretty and silly girl, who gets complements on her fur, as it’s kinda rare to find a Doberman coat on a Catahoula. You can find her in my post history, too. Now next one is a dog I love to death, Theo. Theo is a pitbull, but is also deaf. I’ve always wanted a bully breed, and I’ve also always wanted the challenge of a disabled dog, and lo and behold, right when my dad was looking for a new dog, we found Theo, the silliest dog ever. He’s a big oaf, and he can’t stand not being around humans. Whenever we’re on the porch, and he’s behind the fence, he starts doing his shriek/bark thing until we let him out, which kinda sounds like Chewbacca, and he is a very handsome dog. He is muscular, even for a pitbull, and has a very nice coat (but is isn’t very unique for his breed) and is a big cuddle bug. The only issues with him is that he wants to chew on everything, and sometimes gets to playful and hyper.

This is probably some mild depression talking here, and part of things that I've been dealing with in life in general, but I've been feeling a bit better about things and have been actively trying to look at how I view the world. 

For some context, I always enjoyed making little projects with electronics - building drones, clocks, toys little gadgets what have you but as of late, I just keep telling myself ""why... some company makes this better for cheaper"". 

This type of mentality has only seeped it's way through other aspects of life to the point where it was like: ""Why play this videogame, it's just a waste of time"" and in general this type of mentality started taking up more and more of my time, as the obvious conclusion to things was to just do nothing and stare at the void. 

Now I'm really trying to change that because I realize just how important the process is to any of those things. It doesn't matter even if it fails, at the end of the day you would have learned something. It just boils down to putting in the time and effort to make or do something for it's own sake. Maybe something will come out of it or maybe it won't, but the act of doing something in itself will have one way or another been beneficial to you. And hey, if you share what you did with others maybe it will inspire them to do the same, who's to say. 

Also don't fall in the trap of ""oh I only did 50% of what I was supposed to, it's a failure""! SO WHAT! Maybe you only ran half a mile, maybe you burned the risotto you tried to cook, but you know what, YOU STILL DID IT, SO GO YOU!

Lastly, I feel like a lot of this can be accentuated by the whole quarantine situation we find ourselves in, since maybe we feel like we can't share our lives quite as much with our normal social circles, but you know, stay strong, we'll get  through this!

My nipples are weird and I am a very hairy guy. I never even took my shirt off at the beach (or if I did, it took me lots and lots of mental effort)

Lately (last 4 months) I got down to 64kgs which is 20kgs or 40 pounds less !!!!

I also decided not to care about stuff like body hair or my nipples.. a thing I couldn't change anyways as let's be real noone ever saw a shirtless dude and kept analysing his nipples in public. If noone else cares why would I?


So I hit up the skatepark like I always do and because it was very hot and I wore a black shirt I decided to take my shirt off. And noone cared, noone gave a flippity about it!

I realised that I am the only one who thought this mattered anything.

So yeah I finally got confident with my body and this year I might even go to the beach without feeling bad. 

I FEEL AMAZING!!! I even have some ab muscle separation forming!!! I soon might get a six pack for the first time in my life!!! (maybe then I will get rid of some of the hair to show it off hahah)",0

She offered me some. I was intrigued, but also mildly disgusted, and politely declined. My family is Asian, and I was raised eating cooked vegetables (mostly stir-fry with a little bit of oil, but also in soups), not raw ones. My experience with salad is limited.

I like vegetables, and do make an effort to eat healthy. But raw bell peppers? That's always been a bit too much for me.

another milestone reached, now its time to find my very own place to live!! I already have a couple ideas, now it’s just about saving up to get there! thank you all so much for the encouragement on my last post. I cried happy tears seeing so many kind folks wishing me good luck and congratulations on my job. I hope to update you all again when I get my own place to live!",0

I had to come to the realization that self criticism is okay and necessary. But it can be constructive or destructive. And many of the voices that shattered me down where not my own voice, but all of those of others that left me with their poison. 
So I nicknamed that voice “roach”. Any time she is trying to destruct me with awful, not reasonable criticism I just yell “shut up roach! Come back when you have something useful to say!” 

I recognize her as part of myself. And told her many times that I will listen if she is kind and constructive.

Well a few days ago he was talking about the lgbtq+ community which I am secretly apart of (14m and gay). He brought it up and was saying something about corona so I replied “ well they canceled they’re pride parades and switched to online meetups without any fuss”

Then he started rambling about how gay people are over represented and how only 2% of people are gay. Then he tried to end it by saying “I don’t have any problems with gay people, I just don’t want it shoved in my face”

So I told him straight up “well I’m sure they don’t like it when Christians show up at their PRIDE PARADES screaming about how they’re going to hell for being themselves”

He went quiet and left the living room while mumbling something lol.

TL: DR; at bottom. 

I have chronic illnesses and am learning how to be responsible for my own healthcare for the first time in my life.  My mom was a medical professional, and I'm her disabled dependent. Whenever she took me to get healthcare services, she always did close to 100% of the talking.

This led to *many* inappropriate, unnecessary, OTT treatments, opinions, diagnoses, etc., over many years.  I didn't fully understand that until I was truly fighting for my life back in 2018.  My mom was telling everyone, myself included, that I'm terminally ill. 

I started to tell medical professionals that I suspect my mom is making me sick in 2019.  I had lost weight at an astonishing rate and continued to be very sick when my mom was around.  A lot of that time is fuzzy to me.

I was in and out of the ER a bunch in 2018.  By early 2019, I started to finally improve. 

A few medically scary days occurred and I begged to go to a different ER - one *NOT* in *my mom's* healthcare system.  I was so exhausted and tired of being wheeled around for attention and sympathy from people she knows within the hospital.  No one there would ever get it, at that point.  I desperately wanted other eyes to see me that were not already influenced by my mom. 

My mom reluctantly agreed to take me to a different hospital in town, and I was treated in the ER for a medication almost-overdose and suspected failure to thrive.  

Less than 15 minutes in, the ER kicked my mom out, put sherriffs outside of my door, and an argument over if they could admit me ensued.  I wanted to leave AMA because I was scared I'd die in a hospital without my mom.  That is the true belief I had at the time.  My survival depended upon it.  I felt trapped.

About 4 insane hours later, I was released into my boyfriend's care.  Despite being about 80lbs, I was completely medically stable and ended up an integer away from a ""true"" medication overdose.  The hospital couldn't medically or psychiatrically hold me due to those technicalities.  

Nothing came of this situation, and it took me a year to realize that the doctors weren't trying to punish *me* by trying to admit me to the hospital and by kicking out my mom.  I think in hindsight, that specific ER was the closest anyone had come to figuring out the real situation.  I now know that the fresh medical eyes *did* suspect my mom was making me sick, but there still just wasn't enough information.  (My mom had administered the medication I had way too much of, but no one asked and I didn't think to mention it.) 

Needless to say, I hadn't been back to an ER since that atrocious experience.  I avoided a lot of my medical problems and medical the last year.  What transpired made my hospital and medical phobia even worse.  It didn't help that my mom blamed me for ""not defending her"" and continues to complain about the ER's atrocious treatment of her.  

My mom went as far as to lie to others and tell them *NO* visitors are allowed to see me, per the ER *and* my wishes.  That was absolutely false, and the ER told my mom that when she was storming out.  She lied to my sister in the parking lot and told her *I* didn't want her as a visitor.  I found that out later when my mom was trying to get sympathy for being kicked out and let it slip.  My sister believed her and didn't even go into the building, despite having driven there to see me.  We've been estranged for about a year now.

In 2019, I realized I had to lose almost all of my previous healthcare providers.  They treated me like I had a mental break from reality when I started mentioning my mom's abuse.  I probably sounded hysterical and a lot of what I said probably made no sense. I was very sick and brainwashed.  No one took me seriously, and worse, they thought my mom was a hero for taking care of her obnoxiously sick daughter.  I couldn't convince them what was going on, so I stopped trying.  It took almost a year for me to be able to speak well enough again to be treated like a person and even try to mention my reality.

Nowadays, I'm double my ""sick weight"" and much more able to articulate my situation.  It still sounds as unbelievable as when I couldn't speak coherently.  Now, the providers who I've had for 6+ months don't doubt me anymore.  I also have worked on creating a new support network, including a team for mental health, and I get outpatient services at a community organization for people with SPMIs.  (Severe and persistent mental illnesses - I had ""major depression disorder"" diagnosed in 2019.)  

A staffer from that organization has gone with me to therapy before, partly to help emphasize that indeed, I'm not crazy, I'm just traumatized.  We joke about how ""it's a process with me, it takes awhile to understand the layers,"" but that everyone has a breakthrough moment eventually.  Sometimes it's a text, sometimes it's an audio clip, sometimes just a story; but she's right.  I've seen people's eyes change from ""No way,"" to ""No way, she's *not* making this up.""  I don't think that's going to revert back to doubt, at this point. 

I also recently got another referral to a domestic violence organization and they *want* to help me now, despite telling me my mom isn't abusing me a year ago.  (I've really tried hard to get help.)  In the last couple weeks, I have recorded some conversations between my mom and I, and sent them to friends and mandatory reporters.

On Thursday, a detective called me.  He wanted to meet with me that day.  He told me that he had gotten a report from APS that I was being abused and that the police would need a statement from me.

I asked if I could get an advocate first, and he said yes, but essentially said, ""Don't keep putting this off.""  I reached out to my contacts and was put in touch with an advocate.  Due to the holiday, I'll need to wait til the weekend is over.

I started to physically process some of my potential evidence yesterday.  After listening to 2 hours of audio and taking notes, I was in bad shape.  I know I had a couple panic attacks.  That's fine and all, I mean they suck, but they do eventually go away.  

Then my left chest started to burn in an unusual and different way.  It wasn't intense pain or anything, but it was very new and caused my right arm to go numb and me to throw up.  It lasted about 20 minutes, and I had residual chest pain when it got better.  Because of the location of the pain, I knew I should be examined.  

I have an extreme fear of medical treatment.  I hate medications.  I hate feeling ""drugged.""  I hate needles soooo much.  It's incredibly hard to ""make me"" go to an ER.  Especially at this point in my life.  

I fear being labeled a psych case for *any* medical malady now, despite a documented history and real diagnoses.  And I know I appeared to be an invalid in 2018-2019.  I still fear being looked at like a lost cause; that pain never really goes away completely.  It has a special kind of hopelessness attached to it, knowing doctors missed the signs again and that I'm going to be punished for hinting at them. 

But, my chest hurt.  My chest hurt hurt badly enough that I threw up (on an empty stomach).  My symptoms caused numbness and shakiness.  My symptoms put me on my ass, and made standing up really painful.  When the symptoms got better, but didn't go away enough, I knew I had to get emergency treatment.  I called a friend, and off we were.

I went into the ER by myself (with my Service Dog) while my friend parked.  I could barely stand and had chest pain, so they got me back pretty quickly.  

I've never described my own symptoms to so many people before.  It was stressful.  They did an EKG, took my blood, and did a chest X-ray (to make sure I didn't throw a clot).  The results were all fine. 

I told the ER doc exactly what was going on when she asked.  I couldn't summarize it.  I said that I have to talk to police about being abused, I've been putting it off forever and actually can't anymore, and that processing the evidence is physically messing me up.  The doc was incredibly kind.  

I said, ""I have PTSD and anxiety, so I know this stuff is normal, but my chest actually does hurt in a not palpitations and not just pounding type of way.  I've got burning underneath my left breast.  I'm sure it's nothing, it's not tremendous pain, and if it were anywhere else, I wouldn't have come to the ER.  It's just the location that's worrisome.""  

The doc asked if I have any family history of heart attacks under age 65.  I replied that my Dad died a year ago at 63 from a heart attack.  I said, ""I'm sure it's nothing, I just wanted to be safe rather than sorry.""  The doc said, ""I'm not going to tell you there is nothing wrong with you,"" despite having just checked my results. 

She asked if I have a POTS diagnosis, per my specific BP and pulse.  I replied no, but I have neurocardiogenic syncope and tachycardia diagnoses (the two POTS problems). ""So basically,"" she said, and I nodded.

The doc mentioned that I see a therapist and Psychiatrist, and asked if there's a reason they don't treat my anxiety/PTSD.  I told her that when I go to Psych, they tell me I'm doing well and to keep going to trauma therapy, etc.  They tell me I'm fine, and that I avoid things and need to stop doing that if I want to move forward.  An example of this is audio files.  I couldn't make myself listen to them because it messes me up too much.  For months.  She asked if my doctors know that, and I said yes, or at least that I mention it.  The only reason I had listened to the audio files earlier was again, because I *have* to. 

The doc also asked why I'm not taking the beta-blocker medication that is prescribed to me.  I replied, ""I'm trying to get out of a complicated abusive situation where I am my mom's dependent and she makes getting and taking my medications very hard.  I'd like to be taking my beta-blockers, but I don't have steady access to them and coming off of them abruptly is even worse on my heart than not taking them.""  (Beta-blockers lower your pulse, so you get a rebound effect where your pulse is HIGHER than had you never the medication, if you abruptly stop the medication.  It takes about 5 days for that to happen, and it's brutal.) 

The doc seemed very surprised by this, stating ""Normally people don't take their beta-blockers because they feel sluggish, tired, and gain weight.  Would you take them if you had consistent access?""  I replied, ""Absolutely!  I love that medication.  I actually asked for a higher dose because I pass out less when my pulse isn't able to shoot up so high, plus I feel more rested and energetic because my pulse rests low enough to comfortable.""  Doc summarized, ""So beta-blockers make you feel normal, not sluggish.""  She said, ""it sounds like benzodiazepines would help.""  I told her that they absolutely do, but no one wants to prescribe them anymore.

The doc treated me with an IV benzodiazepine and fluids.  She wrote a referral for a specific type of cardiologist and wants me too see my doctor before I try to sort through anymore evidence. 

Nobody treated me like a crazy or hysterical or overly dramatic person.  The doc left *every* psych mention off of my discharge papers.  I think that she, as a young female, knows how damaging those notes are for young female patients.  In her mind, I was having a completely ""acceptable"" reaction to trauma.  I'm already doing everything a patient can to mitigate the psych symptoms, so piling onto it won't be helpful.  I beyond appreciated this experience.  

I never thought I could be treated compassionately and accurately by speaking for myself about my own medical reality, but it happened!  It's pretty amazing to realize I *can* represent myself, even in a nerve-wracking medical situation.  I'm taking doc's advice *NOT* to push myself and to see my regular doc first.  And now I know I don't have to be ashamed to follow through on the cardio referral because my situation was entered as a cardiac situation, not as a psychiatric one.  

Overall, I think I'm really lucky I got the exact attending doctor that I did, and despite the circumstances, the ER visit felt like a win.  Unlike a hospital visit with my mom, I left with my better health, improved sanity, and intact dignity.  That's completely new for me.

TL: DR; I went into the ER with chest pain and was treated and released for chest pain.",0

I felt myself hitting one and actually went to my doctor. The advice is pretty much always the same. Exercise, do things you like, etc. Everything that is difficult to do while depressed. 

But my medication did increase, and I felt a little better today and actually went out for some exercise. I had told my doctor I bike to and from work, so I'm getting exercise, but he changed my perspective on that. He said exercise associated with work doesn't have the same benefits. You're thinking about work, and it's *for* work, not for yourself. 

So I went out and put on some music I like and walked. And a couple times, I jogged. The anxiety about people seeing me (overweight) jogging meant I couldn't do as much as I wanted to, but it was more than I had done previously! 

After this long I don't feel like I can ""recover"" from depression, but I know I need to at least pull myself back up to a functioning level so I'm not a distraction at work or upsetting my wife at home. One walk won't change my life, but I hope I can make it a habit.",0

I’m happy I’m not on adderall anymore even though I still have some lingering side effects especially anxiety and depression. On a positive note, my jaw doesn’t tense up as much now :)

Anyway, I'm learning to self soothe and allow myself to experience genuine connection with people! Usually I'm too convinced that I rest of a knife's edge of people loathing me if I make the tiniest wrong step, but I'm learning to ask my close friends for tiny pieces of validation and just say ""hey, no one hates me right now, right?"" so that people can just say ""correct"" and we can all move on. 

I'm allowing myself to be hyperemotional rather than repressing it, and learning to channel that in good directions! It's scary, but I'm letting myself watch things that make me emotional - I stopped that when I was about 14 because I was being told that my feelings were dumb and cringey. I'm 26 now and I can finally let myself cry at ridiculous things again, and enjoy melodrama in healthy (fictional) ways! 

I'm also putting effort into making myself food that I like, and noticing my likes and dislikes! I noticed recently that I absolutely loathe bread crusts, so now I cut them off and I'm allowed to just enjoy my hummus-and-sriracha-on-rye monstrosity. I'm allowed to enjoy things! I'm allowed to exist in a way that works for me!

I've been putting in so much effort. BPD is such an all encompassing condition, and it's so hard. It's nice to celebrate the little things, and it's nice to know that even with the constant battling and the impossibly difficult bits, I still get to be happy and excited to be alive. 

So yeah. That's my thing.",0
