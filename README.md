# Spero, the Multi-Award Winning Depression Analysis App

## Motivation :tada:
* We developed this project to help provide more resources for those struggling with mental health. From our research, we found many communities lack the resources to even identify if they have depression, as many commonly go undiagnosed due to stigma. Our project is dedicated to helping those in need and we hope to inspire others to continue in creating user friendly programs for those suffering from mental illness. 

## Purpose 
Effectively, Spero has broken the boundary of diagnosing depressioin, as it is normally only tested for within professional spaces with a formal survey while our app can identify symptoms through a user's nature of speech
